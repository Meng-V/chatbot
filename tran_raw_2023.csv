17:28:11 - Patron : I just wanted to know if I could get this module done now
17:28:30 - Abigail Morgan : I'm not sure what module you are referring to
17:29:34 - Patron : I'm at the beginning with the (Ask a Librarian) part.
17:29:46 - Patron : all
17:29:48 - Abigail Morgan : What class is this for?
17:30:23 - Abigail Morgan : But you can ask me whatever questions you need to get the module completed. I will do my best to help
17:30:35 - Patron : I didn't think of that.
17:31:54 - Patron : Hold on
17:36:45 - Patron : Sorry for the delay. I'm not familiar enough with the classes at this point. But I would like to take classes in Creative Arts and Game Designing at some point in the future. Though, I'm not sure how qualified I am for the later.
17:39:12 - Patron : My brother told me we were already going to be in a class about improving our english skills as a basic requirement. Or at least, that's what I remember.
17:39:41 - Patron : I could have some information wrong, though.
17:41:00 - Abigail Morgan : It sounds like you need to speak to an academic advisor
17:41:20 - Abigail Morgan : Are you a current student? 
17:42:34 - Patron : No. I am just starting college this coming spring.
17:43:56 - Abigail Morgan : OK. I'm just a librarian, so I can't really speak to scheduling classes, etc. But there should be someone you can speak to at the admissions office, or the student success center: <a href=""https://www.miamioh.edu/emss/offices/student-success-center/index.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.miamioh.edu/emss/offices/student-success-center/index.html</a>
17:44:08 - Abigail Morgan : they will have a lot more insight and help
17:46:02 - Patron : Thanks! But I did this chat to complete a module. And I may need to hold off on the rest, in a while. Will this conversation be saved for a later date?
17:46:41 - Patron : My brother should come by to help me though this, at some point today.
17:46:56 - Abigail Morgan : I will have a transcript on the backend. If you have a Miami email address I can send it to you. 
17:47:19 - Abigail Morgan : However, the chat service here will stop at 6pm and start tomorrow morning at 9am
17:48:58 - Patron : Oh, ok. That's a nice heads-up. Thanks. I do have a Miami email address.
17:49:50 - Patron : Is it already connected, or do I have to send it on the chat?
17:50:33 - Abigail Morgan : You will need to send a new chat message. I won't be the person on chat tomorrow morning. You should tell them you are completing a module for pre-college orientation, that will help them understand what you need better
17:50:56 - Abigail Morgan : Oh, your Miami email should already be working
17:51:10 - Patron : Ok, Thanks.
17:51:27 - Abigail Morgan : but if you want me to send you this transcript, you need to tell me what your email is
17:53:21 - Patron : cherryap@MiamiOH.edu
17:53:36 - Patron : Do I need to give the password too?
17:53:38 - Abigail Morgan : OK, thanks
17:53:49 - Abigail Morgan : NO, don't give me your password
17:53:57 - Abigail Morgan : keep that confidential
17:55:08 - Patron : Alright. Thanks.
17:55:31 - Abigail Morgan : OK, I will email you this conversation. 
17:56:35 - Abigail Morgan : OK sent. 
17:56:47 - Abigail Morgan : Have a good night, and hope completing the module is easy
17:56:53 - Patron : Awesome.

15:09:01 - Katie Gibson : Yes, you are using the Ask A Librarian service
15:09:12 - Katie Gibson : it might not have worked if it is after our hours.
15:09:22 - Patron : Awesome
15:09:54 - Katie Gibson : In January, the service closes at 6

https://brill.com/view/journals/soan/30/2/article-p170_3.xml

I feel like I need some kind of tutorial -- not on how to locate sources using Miami Libraries resources, but rather on how to use Miami Libraries to access secondary sources that i learn of through my own research. I'm embarking on a third book project, and it's constantly the case that I find myself (a) trying to figure out whether I have access to an article through Miami Libraries; and (b) if not, how to get access. I know there must be tips and tricks for this kind of search, but I just don't know what they are.","","23","","12:50:10 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Hi Michele, I will take a look for this and get back with you
12:50:44 - Jaclyn Spraetz : To find articles through Miami, there are a few different places you can go. You can go to ""Articles and More"" on our library website as well as ""Journals and More"" to see what access we have to specific journals
12:51:16 - Jaclyn Spraetz : You can also link up your Miami Libraries account with Google Scholar and see what is available that way. If you search an article Miami has access to, it will say something like ""Find at Miami""
12:51:18 - Patron : I looked by typing the title into ""OneSearch"" and then into ""Articles &amp; More"" -- but it sounds like I should also try ""Journals and More""
12:51:49 - Patron : Where is ""Journals and More"" btw?
12:52:04 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Oh whoops, it's called ""E-Journals"" 
12:52:08 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Sorry for the confusion! 
12:52:35 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Yes, this is a good place to go to double check on what we have access to
12:52:38 - Patron : got it, I am going to try that now
12:53:22 - Jaclyn Spraetz : It looks like Society and Animals has a full text delay on articles for 3 years so this article is not available to us yet, however you can request it through interlibrary loan and it should get to you fairly quickly
12:53:42 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Here is the link to interlibrary loan: <a href=""https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html"" target=""_blank"">https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html</a>
12:54:14 - Patron : Yes, i saw that -- so, for future reference, if google scholar fails (since I already am linked to that) i would try e-journals, then go to ILL if the article I need isn't available that way.
12:54:56 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Yes exactly. What I often look for in E-Journals is the date of what articles are available 
12:55:12 - Jaclyn Spraetz : And you can also browse through journals that way as well
12:55:25 - Patron : Would e-journals also be the place to search if i'm looking for an article that isn't actually in a scholarly journal, something like a book review from 1948, for example?
12:56:22 - Jaclyn Spraetz : It's best to search specific journal titles in e-journals. You may try looking for a book review in ""articles and more"" although I may be able to find a better way
12:56:29 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Hold on just a moment while I look more into this
12:58:07 - Jaclyn Spraetz : It looks like we have some access to the database Book Review Index Online: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/book-review-index-online"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/book-review-index-online</a>
12:58:17 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Here is a guide on book reviews with some other sources: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/history/advanced"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/history/advanced</a>
13:01:32 - Patron : Thank you for those resources! Earlier i was seeking a book review in Saturday Review, and was told that the only way to get it was to request a print copy of the bound journal; but I just tried typing Saturday Review into ""e-journals"" and it took me to an electronic version of the journal edition that I need. So, e-journals is going to be my new first stop when seeking things. Thank you for teaching me to fish! Ironic, since I am seeking articles on salmon, actually on autobiographies of salmon, but I digress
13:02:02 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Haha so glad you found it! 
13:02:22 - Patron : thanks, have a nice day!

16:45:27 - Katie Gibson : On the catalog record, click where it says connect to resource on the left
16:45:47 - Katie Gibson : and that takes you to the journal page
16:46:07 - Katie Gibson : use the volumes/chapters dropdown to get to the specific volume you need
16:46:57 - Patron : OK let me try
16:46:59 - Katie Gibson : oh, no wait
16:47:12 - Katie Gibson : now it's telling me we have to purchase that .pdf
16:47:37 - Katie Gibson : So that's an error in the catalog I'll need to report
16:47:50 - Katie Gibson : but we do have volume 10 and 11 in print in our off-site storage

16:48:41 - Katie Gibson : and volume 26 and 28 will need to be requested through InterLibrary loan
16:51:22 - Patron : OK I see. Since I am looking for PDFs, For vol 10 and 11 can I also do an ILL? Will such a request will go through?
16:51:49 - Katie Gibson : yes you can request a scan of the articles in the SW Depository
16:52:45 - Katie Gibson : when you click ""request item"" in the catalog record I sent, at the top of the page there is a link that says ""article from SW Depository""
16:53:00 - Katie Gibson : click that, and they'll digitize just the article you need from each of the volumes
16:55:21 - Patron : Thanks I'll do that.
16:55:31 - Patron : Thanks for your help. Have a good one!

11:27:53 - Barry Zaslow : That's OK. We have a lot of challenges with connections. Anyway, for some reason our online availability for Changing English is for years 1998-2004 only, so I suggest using Interlibrary Loan at <a href=""https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html"" target=""_blank"">https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html</a>. You create a free account using your unique ID/password and put in new request, article, and fill in the boxes with the citation. The staff will try to find it and have the institution scan it to your e-mail. There are at least two Ohio schools that own the 2011 volume so it shouldn't be too difficult. Hope this helps.
11:28:50 - Patron : Oh.  Would it be an electronic file?
11:29:22 - Patron : I'm an out of state grad student.
11:30:22 - Barry Zaslow : I was just saying that since the item is readily available in Ohio, it shouldn't take too long for someone to agree to scan it (as a PDF) to your e-mail; sometimes we have to get things from overseas or a far-flung library in Alaska and it takes weeks.
11:32:36 - Barry Zaslow : Does this make sense?
11:33:00 - Patron : Ok.  Got it.  Thank you!
11:34:09 - Barry Zaslow : You're welcome. If you get really confused or it seems to be taking too long reach out to Sheila Sparks next week at sparkssk@miamioh.edu--she's the interlibrary loan expert and is very kind and helpful.
11:40:15 - Patron : Ok.  Just put in an ILL request.  Will wait and see what happens.  Sheila Sparks is an easy name to remember, so will connect as needed.

10:27:43 - Patron : Right. I have the 4th edition myself! I was just hoping for 2 copies of the new one.
10:30:23 - Roger Justus : Yea, doesn't look like we have any copies of the new one, you could request we purchase it from your subject librarian Jenny Presnell (presnejl@miamioh.edu) I am looking to see if Ohio Link has one we can request as well, just a moment the sites a little slow.  If you want to put the other book in as well I can start looking for that as well

10:33:50 - Patron : ok
10:36:34 - Roger Justus : Ok the second book is available via OhioLink...from a few different places (again you can also talk to Jenny about getting a copy for ourselves) and I am seeing if any are available.

10:38:25 - Patron : It's 2011 so not like that recent
10:39:29 - Patron : ok - I found it on OH link. A m I allowed to request 2 copies or should I just have my RA request her own?
10:40:04 - Roger Justus : You could do either way, but it may be simpler for the RA to do their own.

13:15:21 - Ginny Boehme : I'm not seeing your name in the directory, which makes me think there is an issue with your enrollment status. Can you give me your email and I will forward your information on to someone who may be able to help. In the meantime, the public library has Kanopy, so you can sign up for an account through them and see about getting access to the film you need
13:16:54 - Patron : ballea@miamioh.edu  I tried signing up through the public library. The library I have a card with was not on the site. Germantown, Ohio Public Library
13:18:00 - Ginny Boehme : Current students should be able to sign up for a library card for the Lane Library in Oxford. I'm not sure if they let you sign up as a distance student though. I'm checking right now with someone who might be able to help us with this
13:18:19 - Patron : Thank you
13:22:02 - Ginny Boehme : Ok so no good news here
13:23:43 - Ginny Boehme : Because you're not in the directory, this probably needs to be taken to the department head to start. Which could take a while to get your account figured out. If you are able to get to the library on the middltetown campus, that should let you access kanopy and watch waht you need in the short term
13:24:30 - Patron : So who do I need to call to fix this?
13:24:37 - Ginny Boehme : I will report this to our IT folks so we can try to get your account sorted, but you may need to let your professor know and see if they can be flexible for now
13:25:29 - Patron : Okay. Thank you.

We can put things on reserve for almost any CCA type classes at Amos, although students will have more hours to use them at King or Wertz. This is Stefanie's e-mail: hillessa@miamioh.edu. Hope this helps.

16:30:47 - Zachary Grisham : Or just a normal book?
16:32:25 - Zachary Grisham : You still there Audrey?
16:37:56 - Zachary Grisham : Well, if it is a textbook no. Textbooks can only be checked out for two hours at a time. The easiest way to access textbooks is to speak with the library workers at the circulation desk on the first floor. Since I have not heard back from you for over five minutes I am going to disconnect chat though. Feel free to chat again if you have any other questions!

19:38:49 - Barry Zaslow : OK. Let me search for that.
19:39:04 - Patron : thank you very much
19:42:06 - Barry Zaslow : It looks like the 2001 edition is checked out. There are some newer editions in OhioLINK--if you are a Miami student or staff member you should be able to request them by going to the library homepage and choosing the blue OhioLINK in the middle of the screen and then putting in the title/author (or keywords). Does this make sense?
19:42:42 - Barry Zaslow : It should have a Request Item button and you then put in your unique ID/password and ask to have it sent from another school to one of our libraries
19:43:30 - Patron : sounds great
19:43:48 - Patron : so can i make request to rent it?
19:44:15 - Barry Zaslow : It shouldn't cost anything to get it from the other university. You can keep it for at least three weeks and more if no one else needs it.
19:44:47 - Barry Zaslow : You do have to make the request yourself since I can't know your password!
19:45:33 - Patron : could you please send me the link of library page?
19:46:34 - Barry Zaslow : Here is the Miami Libraries' website: <a href=""http://www.lib.miamioh.edu"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lib.miamioh.edu</a>
19:48:42 - Barry Zaslow : You should see the word OhioLINK in blue in the middle above the red star icon that says My Guide. Click on that blue link and then put in your search and you should get some schools that have the book available, and a green Request Item button next to them on the left.
19:49:58 - Barry Zaslow : There are a few steps to follow, starting with a drop-down menu that asks for your school, then your unique ID/password, then where you want it sent (King, Art/Arch, Music, or a regional campus). Once you submit it should say the title was requested from Cedarville, or Ohio State, or wherever
19:54:43 - Barry Zaslow : I  have to go now but if you  get confused and have a phone with you give the desk at King a call at 513-529-4141. There are staff people there till 1am tonight and again from 7am tomorrow who can talk through this. Good luck with your project.

14:55:01 - Laura Birkenhauer : There's also this other database Kristen recommends, IEEE Xplore <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/ieee-xplore"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/ieee-xplore</a> That has standards too. 
14:55:31 - Laura Birkenhauer : I think the question about getting access to it would be one to ask Kristen about, <b>adamsk3@miamioh.edu!</b>
14:55:55 - Laura Birkenhauer : She is the librarian for this area and an expert in all of the related resources
14:56:03 - Laura Birkenhauer : But before you do that, let's check the other database
14:56:34 - Patron : Okay perfect, thank you for the information.
14:56:42 - Patron : Is there any other database to check?
14:57:07 - Laura Birkenhauer : IEEE Xplore <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/ieee-xplore"" target=""_blank""><a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/ieee-xplore"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/ieee-xplore</a></a> That was the other one recommended on Kristen's guide
14:57:29 - Patron : Sounds good ! thank you so much for your help! I appreciate it.
14:58:18 - Laura Birkenhauer : You're very welcome! Make sure you scroll down on this page too and try some of the other things Kristen recommends <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/standards/finding"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/standards/finding</a> (go past the Databases box)
15:00:14 - Laura Birkenhauer : Yeah, so I'm not finding them in IEEE Xplore either. I didn't find them in print in our catalog. You can try the ""Electronic Options"" Kristen lists and then I'd go ahead and shoot her an email! She'll be happy to consult with you via email or can one-on-one virtually or in-person
15:01:55 - Laura Birkenhauer : Please come back if you have further questions! I have to log out of chat now, my shift is over. But there are two other librarians available to help :) Have a great day!

14:01:31 - Ginny Boehme : I will ask Jenny Presnell if she has any other ideas, but I think this is the best we can do right now
14:02:09 - Patron : okay it is better than what i had before! thank you!

I am a graduate student and I need some help doing research for my Independent Study. I am working on using grants to fund NGO and I am interested in determining the most common funding options for these organizations.","","35","","17:56:37 - Patron : Hello Mr. Dahlquist
17:57:06 - Mark Dahlquist : Hi! Thanks for this interesting question. Are you interested a particular type of NGO?<br />
17:57:31 - Patron : Mainly I am interested in environmental and conservation NGO
17:58:32 - Mark Dahlquist : Thanks, and are you interested in information about how NGOs are funded in general, or information focusing specifically on the grant elements of NGO funding?<br />
18:00:30 - Patron : I guess I can start with general. I am starting on the premise that NGOs will benefit from having a staff member trained on searching and applying for grants as opposed to hiring a project manager once in a while. I am hoping to create a tool to help educate staff on basic grant writing skills.
18:02:47 - Mark Dahlquist : Ok; give me a moment to search for some items on this.<br />
18:03:20 - Mark Dahlquist : One resource I came across right away is this: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip,url,uid,cpid&amp;custid=s9002934&amp;db=cat00344a&amp;AN=mucat.b5045700&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;profile=eds_cat"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip,url,uid,cpid&amp;custid=s9002934&amp;db=cat00344a&amp;AN=mucat.b5045700&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;profile=eds_cat</a><br />
18:03:50 - Mark Dahlquist : There's also a newer edition of this ""For Dummies"" book that we don't have.<br />
18:03:57 - Patron : She is awesome I took a grant writing class with her over the summer as a CEU
18:03:58 - Mark Dahlquist : I'll keep looking for some additional resources.<br />
18:04:07 - Mark Dahlquist : Oh, how cool!<br />
18:04:51 - Mark Dahlquist : She's also the author of the updated edition. <br />
18:04:57 - Patron : I was searching on the databases for economics but no luck. I am trying to get articles related to this topic.
18:05:15 - Patron : She is very methodical yet concise
18:05:20 - Mark Dahlquist : I
18:06:01 - Mark Dahlquist : I'll see if I can find some articles. There is a copy of the newer edition of the Browning book that you could request from another university through OhioLINK: <a href=""https://olc1.ohiolink.edu/record=b43461360~S0"" target=""_blank"">https://olc1.ohiolink.edu/record=b43461360~S0</a><br />
18:06:36 - Patron : I am off campus and in Florida. Would that be a possibility? Or I can request it at my local library
18:07:10 - Mark Dahlquist : Your local library might be an easier option in that case.<br />
18:07:24 - Mark Dahlquist : Here's another ebook I found: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cat00344a&amp;AN=mucat.b4432879&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=cat00344a&amp;AN=mucat.b4432879&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site</a><br />
18:07:55 - Mark Dahlquist : Oh, we also have the 2022 Browning as an ebook after-all.<br />
18:08:08 - Patron : Cool!
18:08:08 - Mark Dahlquist : Here are some additional results: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;bquery=grant+writing&amp;cli0=FT1&amp;clv0=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;bquery=grant+writing&amp;cli0=FT1&amp;clv0=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site</a><br />
18:09:23 - Mark Dahlquist : I'm not sure how focused these are on NGOs in particular, however.<br />
18:09:43 - Patron : That is fine. I am sure they will have valuable information. Which database do you suggest I use to find information about current funding practices for NGO?
18:10:59 - Mark Dahlquist : Hmm give me a moment to check on this, please.<br />
18:11:08 - Patron : Thank you.
18:14:45 - Mark Dahlquist : Hmm; I'm finding some good articles in Google Scholar, and some useful books, but they often tend to focus of particular types of NGOs, such as environmental ones, rather then the category as a whole.<br />
18:15:17 - Patron : Environmental NGOs will be great!
18:17:32 - Mark Dahlquist : Google Scholar could be useful for this search, since it permits citation tracking. You can look for an older article, such as ""Funding for NGOs: Issues and options"" (1987) and then click on the ""cited by"" link and find more recent articles that have cited the older one.<br />
18:18:00 - Mark Dahlquist : Let me take a look for some environmental examples as well. Hold on one moment please.<br />
18:18:36 - Mark Dahlquist : (also, make sure to access Google Scholar through the tab on the Miami University Library homepage).<br />

I also need data on Gen Z and their need for instant gratification","","34","","15:53:28 - Zachary Grisham : Hey Max, I can help you with that!
15:53:57 - Zachary Grisham : In what context?
15:54:05 - Zachary Grisham : Psychology, marketing, etc...?
15:55:07 - Patron : I am trying to develope an integrated marketing campaign about an app that allows people to quickly and easily reccomend tv shows and recieve recommendations from their family and close friends. My target audience is Gen X and I wanted to know if they had any data for a desire on instant gratification; and also Gen Z for potentially marketing to Gen X through them
15:55:59 - Zachary Grisham : So, emarketer has limiters by generation. 
15:56:13 - Zachary Grisham : We could look there and I think that Psycinfo would be a good choice as well.
15:56:22 - Zachary Grisham : One second. 
15:56:37 - Zachary Grisham : I will take a glance
16:00:22 - Zachary Grisham : Hey Max, found a tiny bit of stuff on APA Psycinfo but it seems to be categorized under self control. 
16:00:26 - Zachary Grisham : Nothing on emarketer. 
16:00:40 - Zachary Grisham : Have you looked into MRI Simmons insights yet?
16:00:57 - Zachary Grisham : They also go by generation and have psychographic information.
16:01:17 - Patron : I have not looked at those. Did you find any good links that I may use?
16:02:19 - Zachary Grisham : MRI Simmons is a database that you create tables, it will take me a minute to see if it is in there. 
16:02:36 - Zachary Grisham : However, in Mintel we have an entire report on marketing to Generation Z
16:03:01 - Zachary Grisham : Would you be interested in that?

16:05:56 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, 
16:06:08 - Zachary Grisham : I have not been able to find much specifically on them yet. 
16:07:00 - Zachary Grisham : It looks like there is some older stuff on it though.

16:10:16 - Zachary Grisham : Under the unrealistic and materialistic views section they talk about instant ggratification and TV.
16:12:51 - Zachary Grisham : I also found something else interesting looking at the digital nativity levels of the diffferent generations.
16:13:05 - Zachary Grisham : As you are interested in creating an app you might find it useful.
16:13:51 - Zachary Grisham : hey Max, you still there?
16:14:44 - Patron : Yes, thank you this has been very helpful

12:46:38 - Patron : A university typically presents the award.  The title is usually provided to the student.  Some universities have the student purchase the book.

17:03:46 - Roger Justus : Ok I just got in, what error message are you getting and are you on or off campus.  
17:04:23 - Patron : I am off campus. I am getting this message ""Your account is not authorized to use this service.

17:05:19 - Roger Justus : interesting, ok, lets try this close the browser window that you are using for this, and open a new one, go to the Miami libraries page (lib.miamioh.edu) 
17:06:12 - Roger Justus : and when you get there to to A-Z databases and click the s try the link about mid-way down the page for SRDS and lets see if that helps
17:06:42 - Roger Justus : if this is how you got to it before apologies and we can try another way.

17:08:28 - Roger Justus : or faculty of course...
17:10:18 - Patron : student. . well former student. I actually just graduated in May. Was hoping I still had access to this. I work at an ad agency now. My email is magyarm2@miamioh.edu. Any chance I could get access to it? Even if it's for a day or two
17:11:22 - Roger Justus : Afraid not, the licensing agreements only allow current students.  Was there something in particular you were trying to get?  Maybe I can look it up and send it to you.
17:17:10 - Patron : Okay got it. Thank you. I'm interested in reading the ""CONSUMER LISTS"" section, specifically the diet/health section. I'm not sure how SRDS's database is structured, but I'm reading they should have ""buyer"" lists; for example, they might contain the names of the several million people who bought a specific diet product in the last few years.  Or, it could be a list of people who have bought books by mail, tools by mail, etc. It seems like an excellent way to understand consumer psychology and consumer markets
17:17:49 - Roger Justus : Ok, let me look give me a sec!<br /><br />
17:18:04 - Patron : Thank you!
17:26:59 - Roger Justus : Well, my experience with this db is limited, it looks like it has that but it is about 10 different places.  I will check with our business librarian to see if he has a suggestion about where you can get that info for free or as an Miami alum.  But here are a few sites you may be able to get similar data from that I know of

12:11:27 - Laura Birkenhauer : It does normally ask you to login. Can you tell me more about what's happening?
12:11:35 - Laura Birkenhauer : I'd be glad to report an issue if there is a problem happening that I'm not yet aware of. Feel free to send me screenshots or describe what's happening on your end!
12:12:58 - Patron : when i search for Early Education and Development in the keyword search it goes to ebsco and says ""A System Problem has Occurred"" then asks for me to login again
12:13:15 - Laura Birkenhauer : OK! One moment while I look into this. 
12:13:21 - Laura Birkenhauer : By the way, are you on or off campus? 
12:13:51 - Laura Birkenhauer : How are you accessing EBSCO? For example, are you using the ""Articles &amp; More"" search tab on our website, <a href=""https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/?"" target=""_blank"">https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/?</a> Or somewhere else?
12:14:09 - Patron : on campus
12:14:21 - Patron : onesearch
12:15:11 - Laura Birkenhauer : Got it, thanks! Do you happen to have another browser on your computer? For example, I'm using Google Chrome but I also have Microsoft Edge. It might be worth testing another browser!
12:15:14 - Patron : same result when i use articles and more
12:15:22 - Patron : ok, will do.
12:15:26 - Laura Birkenhauer : Gotcha. That's helpful information. 
12:16:48 - Laura Birkenhauer : Another idea: sometimes clearing Browsing Data in your web browser can help, or restarting your device. But, I am happy to report the issue and can get back to you as soon as I hear from Library IT.
12:17:58 - Patron : i used chrome and i got the same result.
12:18:17 - Laura Birkenhauer : Thanks for trying that! I'll move forward with the report. Can you confirm your name and unique ID for me? 
12:19:45 - Patron : darrel davis; davisdr
12:20:55 - Laura Birkenhauer : Thank you! I will put in the report with Library IT now and will follow up with you as soon as I hear back. For now, alternatives may be to try clearing cache and restarting your device, or loaning a device from the library, or using another device in one of the University Libraries locations. I apologize for the inconvenience, I know this can be very disruptive to school assignments and research.
12:22:12 - Patron : i can't even get to ohiolink, it says url cannot be found. :(
12:22:18 - Patron : ok, thanks.
12:22:23 - Laura Birkenhauer : That is very helpful! Thank you.

12:33:04 - Stefanie Hilles : Well, I teach a class at 3 today so, hopefully, very, VERY soon. That being said, I unfortunately don't know how long it will take. It depends on what the issue is, if it's on our end or ebsco's end, etc.

13:40:21 - Laura Birkenhauer : One moment!
13:40:26 - Patron : Thank you
13:42:02 - Laura Birkenhauer : Some of our consumer research databases include MRI Simmons, Mintel, Statista, and SimplyAnalytics. They're all linked here: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/bus/databases"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/bus/databases</a>
13:42:16 - Laura Birkenhauer : They're likely going to include statistics and reports about this information! 
13:42:37 - Laura Birkenhauer : You can do some searching there but also feel free to reach out to Zac or Abi, the librarians listed on the right side of that guide
13:42:49 - Laura Birkenhauer : I can also do some searching and see if I can find useful reports, but it may take me some time
13:42:57 - Laura Birkenhauer : So wanted to go ahead and point you in the right direction!
13:43:02 - Patron : Amazing, thank you!
13:43:10 - Laura Birkenhauer : You're very welcome!
13:49:32 - Laura Birkenhauer : There are a number of reports about Gen Z in Mintel, which you may have already found. I suggest starting there! I searched for gen z and narrowed to reports. I'm not able to share but you can do the same search on your end! 
13:50:15 - Laura Birkenhauer : Some of the other databases, like MRI-Simmons Insights, are a bit more complicated to use. There is a tip sheet linked on the guide I sent you earlier. That's also something you can get help on from Zac or Abi, they'd be glad to assist!
13:50:31 - Laura Birkenhauer : I hope this helps! Please come back if you have any further questions!

Yep, I can help you with this. 
13:12:33 - Zachary Grisham : Have you looked at CINAHL yet?
13:14:35 - Zachary Grisham : Are you there?
13:14:47 - Patron : Yes. I am looking into if income has an effect on the development of type two diabetes in children due to access of healthy food, etc. I have certain databases that I can look into given to me by my professor, and CINAHL is one of them.
13:15:10 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, have you checked that one yet then? 
13:15:31 - Zachary Grisham : If so, there are a few others we can look at. 
13:16:26 - Patron : Yes I have.
13:16:37 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, great! We can look at a few others though. 
13:17:20 - Zachary Grisham : However, this might be a target situation in which we have to look at the effects of eating unhealthy food on diabetes among children and then find another article that shows that low income children eat unhealthy foods. 
13:17:27 - Zachary Grisham : We can see what we can find though!
13:17:50 - Zachary Grisham : Give me a second and I will look at a few databases that might be helpful and let you know if any of them are useful for your research.
13:18:52 - Patron : Thank you!
13:21:09 - Zachary Grisham : Alright, so I found an article talking about the impact of income on the incidence of diabetes. 
13:21:13 - Zachary Grisham : It is in science direct. 
13:21:22 - Zachary Grisham : Have you tried that database yet?
13:22:49 - Patron : I have not. My professor gave us these databases that we were able to find sources within.  “Academic Search Complete”, “CINAHL Plus with Full Text”, “ERIC”, “Health Source: 
Nursing/Academic Edition”, “Medline with Full text”, and “APA Psych Info”.
13:22:58 - Zachary Grisham : There is also one that talks about the prevalence of diabetes in children.
13:23:17 - Zachary Grisham : Would your professor allow you to use Science Direct? It is a wonderful database as well.
13:23:38 - Zachary Grisham : All of those are library databases as is Science Direct.
13:24:00 - Zachary Grisham : Happy to try and use those databases though if you would like?
13:24:53 - Patron : If we could try and see if any good sources are in the ones provided by her I would prefer that first. However, I am open to seeing if I can use databases outside of those given to her in the assingment.
13:25:15 - Zachary Grisham : Ok! 
13:25:22 - Zachary Grisham : I will try those then. 
13:25:30 - Zachary Grisham : Give me a minute to try those.
13:27:53 - Zachary Grisham : Are you looking for research only in America/ Canada, just America, or are studies around the world ok too?
13:28:46 - Patron : really anywhere is ok!
13:28:55 - Zachary Grisham : Ok!
13:35:13 - Zachary Grisham : Alright, after some research I have not been able to find anything that really fits what you are looking for. 
13:36:11 - Zachary Grisham : Oh, one second
13:36:16 - Zachary Grisham : I think I found a few things.
13:36:22 - Patron : Ok!
13:37:11 - Zachary Grisham : In Cinahl I was able to find information on the factors affecting diabetes.
13:37:26 - Zachary Grisham : I used a limiter subject of income and a keyword diabetes.
13:37:38 - Zachary Grisham : Would you like to zoom so I can show you how I did it?
13:37:49 - Zachary Grisham : It might be a bit confusing to write out via chat.
13:39:24 - Patron : My current location does not allow me to be able to zoom unfortunately.
13:39:31 - Zachary Grisham : That is ok!
13:39:40 - Zachary Grisham : I will try to explain it then.
13:40:10 - Zachary Grisham : First I will send you a possible useful article. However, the article is not specifically about children. 
13:40:19 - Zachary Grisham : That does not mean it will be useless though. 
13:41:20 - Zachary Grisham : Many times if you cannot find an article directly on a topic you can use two articles to make your point. As an example, if you can find information stating that income is a factor in diabetes due to eating bad food, then find an article stating that lower income children eat bad food you can link them.
13:41:25 - Zachary Grisham : Does that make sense?
13:41:54 - Zachary Grisham : article link..

13:41:56 - Patron : Yes, it does!
13:42:14 - Zachary Grisham : Great! So, with this article please not under major subjects. 
13:42:31 - Zachary Grisham : Using these you can actually use the subjects to find similar articles.
13:42:44 - Zachary Grisham : I clicked on income AND it got me to that article. 
13:42:58 - Zachary Grisham : I think using prevention and control might also be beneficial.
13:43:57 - Zachary Grisham : It is amazing though how little CINAHL has. 
13:44:21 - Zachary Grisham : You should ask your professor if you can use Science Direct. It had quite a bit more and is still considered a respectable database. 
13:44:35 - Patron : Ok, thank you for your help!
13:44:48 - Zachary Grisham : You are welcome!
13:44:59 - Zachary Grisham : Would you like me to send the other article?
13:45:07 - Zachary Grisham : Just in case your professor allows it
13:46:08 - Patron : Yes, that would be great
13:46:12 - Zachary Grisham : Great!
13:46:15 - Zachary Grisham : Here it is.
13:46:23 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2012.12.005"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2012.12.005</a>
13:46:44 - Zachary Grisham : If it gives you any trouble just type that title into the library search tool and the article will pop right up.
13:46:51 - Zachary Grisham : The impact of income on the incidence of diabetes: A population-based study<br />


13:54:56 - Zachary Grisham : I also found a master's thesis that is exactly on the topic. While your professor will probably not accept it you could use it to create new key words as you search for more articles on the topic. 
13:55:03 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://repository.arizona.edu/bitstream/handle/10150/660120/azu_etd_18918_sip1_m.pdf?sequence=1"" target=""_blank"">https://repository.arizona.edu/bitstream/handle/10150/660120/azu_etd_18918_sip1_m.pdf?sequence=1</a>
13:55:20 - Zachary Grisham : The conclusion section might be especially useful to you.
13:55:33 - Zachary Grisham : It also explains why you might not be finding much on the topic.
13:55:54 - Zachary Grisham : Turns out there is scarce literature on the topic.
13:56:28 - Zachary Grisham : Anyways, can I help you with anything else?
13:58:08 - Patron : No that is all, thank you for your help! I may be switching topics or trying to find another causative factor besides diet like physical activity or education levels in relation to type 2 diabetes since there are not many resources on the topic.
13:58:34 - Zachary Grisham : Ok! Makes sense, feel free to reach out again if you need help researching them. Hope you have a wonderful day!

20:39:41 - Patron : No, my laptop
20:40:24 - Stefanie Hilles : Oh. OK. Sigh. It doesn't look like the return function works on those devices, so that would've explained it.
20:40:45 - Stefanie Hilles : Is there a ""remove from library"" button?
20:40:56 - Patron : It doesn't work on laptops as well? Because I am following the exact instructions.

20:44:17 - Stefanie Hilles : Wait! I found something...MAYBE
20:44:35 - Patron : Ohhhhhh!!!
20:44:39 - Stefanie Hilles : I found this in community support: I had the same problem, I finally tried right clicking on the book in my Adobe library, and there it shows a return item option.
20:44:39 - Patron : Okayy
20:44:54 - Patron : Okay let me try
20:45:59 - Patron : It'll take me a few minutes, so I might not be able to reply immediately. Just wanted to inform you!
20:46:16 - Stefanie Hilles : No worries! I am here until 9 :)
20:46:42 - Stefanie Hilles : I found this too.

20:49:46 - Patron : What is the current status of the ebook titled Teaching Mindful Writers by Brian Jackson?
20:49:59 - Patron : Is it available for all users&gt;
20:50:07 - Patron : *?
20:50:25 - Stefanie Hilles : What do you mean by all users?
20:50:54 - Patron : Like everyone in general. I had borrowed it a few months ago too, I'm just trying to see if the books indeed get returned
20:51:12 - Patron : Is it currently available?
20:52:27 - Stefanie Hilles : Gotchu. It appears to be currently available. I don't want to check it out (because it is also Proquest and I don't want to prevent someone from getting it if they want it) BUT on the other one, the download button was grayed out for me. This one is not grayed out.
20:53:22 - Patron : Okay. Then I guess it is assured that the book I have right now will automatically be available after its due date, right?
20:53:38 - Stefanie Hilles : I would assume....
20:54:09 - Stefanie Hilles : But if you would like, you can tell me when it is due and I can check that day and let you know
20:54:27 - Patron : It is due at 11:57pm on March 6.
20:54:44 - Stefanie Hilles : Excellent! What's your email?
20:54:45 - Patron : I'll check with you again on March 7

I'm currently enrolled in a master's program in writing at Wayne State in Detroit, and we've been asked to ""Find an example of a constructive reflection, reflection-in-presentation, or project-focused reflection assignment"" on which to comment in class. I've been though the English Department's website (I got a bachelor's from there some years ago) and I'm not finding something that I think qualifies. Can you advise?","","36","","15:46:13 - Mark Dahlquist : Thanks for this question; do you need materials of these types that are related to Miami's writing program in particular, or can they be from any program?<br />
15:47:14 - Patron : It's supposed to be related to First Year Composition, so I'm thinking the writing program would be the place to look first...
15:48:55 - Patron : From the way the question is worded, I initially thought that we were asked to locate a specific assignment... in which case that assignment would have to be spelled out in a syllabus and the syllabus be available online...
15:51:44 - Mark Dahlquist : I see, but it could be from any writing program, or would it need to be from the writing program at Miami? <br />
15:52:15 - Patron : No. It could be from any writing program (except, of course, Wayne State's, since that's where the class is held).
15:52:31 - Mark Dahlquist : Great. Hold on a moment, please while I take look for this. <br />
15:52:46 - Patron : I thought of Miami because of the writing program there and because I came from the English and History programs...
15:55:07 - Mark Dahlquist : Yes, there are plenty of assignments like this; however they are for the most part not posted online outside of our course management software. <br />
15:55:23 - Mark Dahlquist : I do find some interesting material online: <a href=""https://www.student.unsw.edu.au/examples-reflective-writing"" target=""_blank"">https://www.student.unsw.edu.au/examples-reflective-writing</a><br />
15:55:55 - Patron : That's what I thought ... and there's no way for me to get into the course management systems unless I'm enrolled in a specific class, correct?
15:57:12 - Mark Dahlquist : That's generally true. Hold on one moment, please.<br />
16:00:11 - Mark Dahlquist : First year composition here at Miami uses a textbook called Rhethawks that I notice is available online. However I'm not sure that it contains assigments similar to what you're seeking. <br />
16:00:22 - Mark Dahlquist : Here's a link to an online version: <a href=""https://www.studocu.com/en-us/document/miami-university/composition-literature/rhethawks-secure-pdf-for-students/34485948"" target=""_blank"">https://www.studocu.com/en-us/document/miami-university/composition-literature/rhethawks-secure-pdf-for-students/34485948</a><br />
16:01:41 - Mark Dahlquist : It seems like it might be a good strategy to search online for the specific type of reflection you need, rather than focusing on Miami in particular.<br />
16:02:39 - Patron : Thank you! The Rhehawks book looks promising.
16:03:13 - Mark Dahlquist : I'm not sure how narrowly your assigment defines these terms, but there are some good reflection assignments online: <a href=""https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/documents/innervate/09-10/0910hurnellpresentation.pdf"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/english/documents/innervate/09-10/0910hurnellpresentation.pdf</a><br />
16:04:40 - Patron : I foresee a problem with searching for a specific type of reflection, since the idea of classifying different types of reflection hasn't really entered into the class dialogue so far. Instead, we've been considering the idea of reflection (usually in the form of a reflective essay) and its impact on student learning in FYC. So it's the doing rather than the form that it takes that seems to be the deciding vector.
16:06:18 - Mark Dahlquist : I guess these concepts are from Kathleen Yancey: <a href=""https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/usupress_pubs/120/"" target=""_blank"">https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/usupress_pubs/120/</a><br />
16:08:04 - Patron : Yes... Her book is one of the texts we're currently using.
16:08:46 - Mark Dahlquist : Yes, you seem to have been asked to find example of assignments that ask students to perform these particular types of reflections. An interesting assignment!<br />
16:10:05 - Mark Dahlquist : You might want to contact someone from Miami's composition program if you have questions that seem unasnwered by the RhetHawks textbook. I'd be provide contact information for this.<br />
16:10:48 - Patron : Thanks very much!
16:12:09 - Mark Dahlquist : You could reach out to Sarah Webb-Sunderhaus with questions about 1st year composition at Miami (webbsusa@miamioh.edu).<br />
16:12:17 - Mark Dahlquist : More information here: webbsusa@miamioh.edu<br />

16:13:08 - Patron : Thanks so much! Is there a way I can save this conversation or have it emailed to me?
16:13:39 - Mark Dahlquist : I'd be happy to email you a copy of this conversation. Can you provide me with your email address?<br />
16:14:08 - Patron : Absolutely. Is a personal email sufficient, or would you prefer one linked to a college?
16:14:46 - Mark Dahlquist : I can send this transcript to whichever address is most convenient. <br />
16:14:53 - Patron : :et
16:15:13 - Patron : Let's use this one then, please: kenandkala@ameritech.net

16:16:17 - Mark Dahlquist : Thanks again for your question, and please let us know if we can help again in the future.
16:17:03 - Patron : Thank you very much! I remember my carral at King library with much fondness, although it's been nearly 40 years since I was there.
16:17:45 - Mark Dahlquist : You're welcome! Very glad to help.<br />

11:53:42 - Barry Zaslow : If these aren't working you can search on the library home page under E-Journals for the Monographs of the society for research in child development as a title. Then it will give you a variety of databases that should have the article from 2012 (look for the range of years covered). You will likely need to just scroll down from more recent years back to that one year and look for the Emotions article. Hope this helps.

Yep, the public is welcome to come in to the library. 
14:07:22 - Patron : Excellent! We will be visiting campus this weekend and it seems we will have about an hour between appointments. Do you have a recommendation where we would find a quiet place to catch up on email and rest?
14:07:50 - Zachary Grisham : I personally like the second floor tables. 
14:08:10 - Zachary Grisham : It is quiet and there is usually a table or two open.
14:08:17 - Zachary Grisham : You can see them all through the stairs. 
14:08:38 - Zachary Grisham : However, we have single study cubicles all throughout the library.
14:09:09 - Zachary Grisham : So, no matter where you go besides the basement, makerspace or right next to the classrooms should be pretty quiet.
14:09:33 - Patron : Thank you! This has been very helpful!
14:09:43 - Zachary Grisham : You are welcome! Can we help with anything else?
14:10:06 - Patron : Not that I can think of. Thanks again.

15:55:06 - Patron : Hi!
15:56:05 - Nate Floyd : Attached a file: <a href=""https://libanswers.lib.miamioh.edu/chat_file.php?i=1286&amp;f=439931"" class=""s-la-cfile"" target=""_blank"">https://libanswers.lib.miamioh.edu/chat_file.php?i=1286&amp;f=439931</a>
15:56:14 - Nate Floyd : Does that look right? I mean, is that the article? 
15:56:41 - Patron : Yes. I just wonder why I can never seem to find New Yorker articles myself
15:57:22 - Nate Floyd : The library's coverage is very spotty, so I just Googled the title you gave me + ""new yorker,"" 
15:58:01 - Nate Floyd : We don't always have access to the stuff on the New Yorker website, and then when we do get access to the articles that appear in print, it's usually quite a delay 
15:58:14 - Patron : Oh, I see.
15:58:25 - Patron : This apparently just came out yesterday
15:59:18 - Patron : Can you help me with a different question?
15:59:28 - Nate Floyd : sure, what's up
16:00:13 - Patron : How do I reup my student subscription to the New York Times?
16:01:49 - Nate Floyd : Sure, here are directions for how to re-up. The only catch (for the moment) is that you need to be on campus wifi to re-up. After that you can access from anywhere, but the re-up sign up has to take place on campus (NY Times rules, not ours, ugh).
16:01:52 - Nate Floyd : <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/newspapers/nyt"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/newspapers/nyt</a>
16:02:39 - Patron : Yes, I knew about being on campus. If I were to install the Miami VPN, would I be able to do it elsewhere?
16:03:44 - Nate Floyd : It should work, but I can't guarantee it, and really no one can. It's just so unreliable. Only recently did the system start inforcing the on campus policy. NY Times let that slide for years during the pandemic. My advice is re-up before you leave campus. 
16:04:03 - Patron : Sounds good! thanks!

16:01:45 - Patron : My unique ID is coxcs
16:03:36 - Jenny Presnell : Blair is in there in that second section --- Who would make a good prime minister -- but it is by comparison between other front runners and Blair and not opinion on his term
16:03:44 - Jenny Presnell : Let me check one other thing online
16:05:09 - Patron : okay thank you!
16:05:24 - Jenny Presnell : try a database called Statista
16:05:34 - Jenny Presnell : It is listed in databases A-Z
16:05:50 - Jenny Presnell : Theresa May is listed
16:06:11 - Jenny Presnell : so I think you will just have to poke around and there may or may not be anything there
16:06:23 - Jenny Presnell : worst case
16:06:41 - Jenny Presnell : you could go to the Times Digital Archive
16:06:43 - Patron : okay I will give that a try! he might be easier to find since he was more recent
16:06:50 - Jenny Presnell : Aslo in Databases a-z
16:06:58 - Jenny Presnell : and see if the paper printed an polls
16:07:06 - Jenny Presnell : which I think would be likely
16:07:12 - Jenny Presnell : but the hunt would be tedious
16:07:17 - Patron : okay I will try that also. Thank you so much for your help!
16:07:18 - Jenny Presnell : try that Satista first
16:07:23 - Jenny Presnell : good luck
16:07:32 - Jenny Presnell : I am the political science librarian
16:07:39 - Jenny Presnell : so if you want you can email me 
16:07:47 - Jenny Presnell : presnejl@miamoh.edu
16:08:01 - Jenny Presnell : or ask through this service -- we all staff it

08:59:45 - Jenny Presnell : I can find references to the Defiance College newspaper, but not a town newspaper
08:59:50 - Jenny Presnell : It is not available digitally
09:00:07 - Jenny Presnell : might Toledo have carried stories
09:00:16 - Patron : The Crescent-News is the name of my hometown paper
09:01:52 - Jenny Presnell : i can find this

09:01:59 - Jenny Presnell : but it isn
09:02:08 - Jenny Presnell : isn't a digital or microfilm copy
09:02:13 - Jenny Presnell : let me try one more thing

09:03:29 - Jenny Presnell : the Defiance PL has microfilm that we could request
09:03:43 - Jenny Presnell : that is a filmed copy of each page of the paper
09:03:53 - Jenny Presnell : so you'd have to pick some years/days and read the paper
09:04:02 - Jenny Presnell : I can think of one other thing
09:05:28 - Jenny Presnell : no
09:05:43 - Jenny Presnell : I have a personal subscription to newspapers.com, but it isn't in there
09:06:12 - Jenny Presnell : Most small town newspapers aren't widely available digitally -- but through microfilm
09:07:00 - Jenny Presnell : you could contact the Defiance Public Library and ask if they have anything digital, otherwise you can put in an Interlibrary Loan Request and we can have them or another library send the film for you to read
09:07:13 - Jenny Presnell : or it could be easier to make a trip home
09:07:45 - Patron : okay thanks

Students may also be asked to enter their anticipated graduation date. When you see START YOUR ACCESS, the expiration time and date of your pass will appear. Go to NYTimes.com and enjoy full access from any location. Faculty, staff, and students will need to renew their access every 6 months from an on campus location, as prompted by the NYT

09:44:04 - Kristen Adams : NYT does change what's needed, yes - I think at one time you could renew from off campus
09:44:18 - Kristen Adams : I think they did that during the pandemic, and now you have to be on campus

Are you off campus? The NYT was allowing people to start or renew from off-campus during the pandemic and a few years after but not presently.
10:29:13 - Patron : I came on campus on Friday to do it
10:30:04 - Barry Zaslow : Did it accept your registration on Friday and now it doesn't work?
10:30:42 - Patron : No, it didn't, I got a message saying a subscription could not be granted (something to that effect) and I took a screenshot

10:31:15 - Patron : Student, yes
10:33:33 - Barry Zaslow : Have you reached out to the NYT help people yet? Their response is sometimes variable. I would start there but if you haven't already sent your screenshot to someone in the libraries I suggest Nate Floyd at floydns@miamioh.edu as he is someone who coordinates these more than just *any* person on chat.
10:34:22 - Patron : I did, I sent the screen shot to the applicable address but have not heard back
10:34:46 - Barry Zaslow : Was that the address at NYT or one of the librarians' e-mails?
10:35:41 - Patron : The NYT
10:36:37 - Barry Zaslow : I suppose they might not have people on weekends (we don't staff chat Saturdays or Sunday morning ourselves). You could at least copy what you sent to them to Nate and see if he says to be patient or has some alternative ideas.
10:36:53 - Patron : I didn't think they would respond during the weekend, either.
10:37:02 - Patron : Ok, sounds good, thanks!
10:37:32 - Barry Zaslow : Sure. Hope you can get this resolved. Anything else at this time?

","75","","11:46:39 - Patron : Hello
11:46:42 - Kristen Adams : Hi there. Can you tell me a bit more about your topic?
11:47:32 - Patron : I am looking for some articles on payment models in Dominican republic (healthcare)
11:48:54 - Kristen Adams : Ok, I tried those keywords in the OneSearch from our homepage and didn't get any results. So we need some other keywords, or broaden the search somehow.
11:49:19 - Kristen Adams : I just tried, 'healthcare' AND 'dominican republic' AND 'payment'
11:49:24 - Kristen Adams : <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip&amp;bquery=healthcare+AND+dominican+republic+AND+payment&amp;cli0=FT1&amp;clv0=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;profile=eds-cat-jy"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip&amp;bquery=healthcare+AND+dominican+republic+AND+payment&amp;cli0=FT1&amp;clv0=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;profile=eds-cat-jy</a>
11:49:31 - Kristen Adams : and there's a few results
11:50:07 - Kristen Adams : I wonder if there's another way to say 'payment model'
11:50:08 - Kristen Adams : ?
11:50:18 - Patron : What database did you use? payment methods
11:50:32 - Patron : payment system
11:50:35 - Kristen Adams : I used OneSearch
11:50:44 - Kristen Adams : which looks at all of our databases
11:51:41 - Patron : Any database in Health Information Technology
11:51:46 - Kristen Adams : I'm not having luck with 'payment method' either
11:52:47 - Patron : Ok
11:52:53 - Kristen Adams : I tried accounting, and didn't find anything either
11:53:09 - Kristen Adams : is it possible to broaden the geographic area?
11:53:14 - Patron : Payment system.
11:53:20 - Patron : I am trying a different database
11:53:29 - Kristen Adams : I've tried just 'payment' as well
11:53:35 - Kristen Adams : to be more broad
11:54:16 - Kristen Adams : The OneSearch (the main search box) on our site, is probably the broadest search we can do, as it searches all the databases for us
11:55:20 - Patron : healthcare or health care or hospital or health services or health facilities
11:55:25 - Kristen Adams : I tried, 'healthcare' AND 'Caribbean' AND 'payment' and got these - <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip&amp;bquery=healthcare+AND+Caribbean+AND+payment&amp;cli0=FT1&amp;clv0=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;profile=eds-cat-jy"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip&amp;bquery=healthcare+AND+Caribbean+AND+payment&amp;cli0=FT1&amp;clv0=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;profile=eds-cat-jy</a>

11:57:50 - Kristen Adams : since it's a health database, I just left off the 'health' term
11:57:55 - Kristen Adams : there's 3 results
11:58:26 - Patron : The goal was to compare the healthcare payment models in the US vs Dominican republic.
11:58:30 - Kristen Adams : Have you found any articles that are good ones? If so you could look those up in Web of Science to see which newer articles cited that one
11:59:10 - Patron : Looking into google scholar
11:59:51 - Patron : ok
12:00:46 - Kristen Adams : I'm needing to sign off as it's the end of my shift, but I'm transferring you to Katie
12:00:57 - Kristen Adams : and I just talked to her about what you are looking for
12:00:58 - Patron : Thanks for the help.
12:01:04 - Patron : I will check google scholars
12:01:07 - Katie Gibson : Hello
12:01:14 - Patron : Hello
12:01:39 - Katie Gibson : Ok, one moment, I'll read the transcript here and see what you've tried so far
12:02:06 - Patron : I am trying google scholars with 'healthcare' AND 'dominican republic' AND 'payment'
12:02:08 - Katie Gibson : Ok, so it's unlikely that you'll find articles that compare both systems
12:02:40 - Katie Gibson : but, you'll fine ones that talk about the Dominican Republic system
12:02:47 - Katie Gibson : and one that discusses the U.S. system
12:02:59 - Katie Gibson : let me do some digging to see what's the best database for you to be searching in
12:03:08 - Patron : Please just focus only on Dominican republic. Thanks
12:03:39 - Katie Gibson : Out of curiosity, which class is this for?
12:04:13 - Katie Gibson : This article might have some useful information: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=b7h&amp;AN=26947702&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=b7h&amp;AN=26947702&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a>

12:05:14 - Katie Gibson : Ah I see

12:06:50 - Katie Gibson : Yeah, I'm finding things about social security but not about the payment system speicifically
12:07:00 - Patron : ok
12:07:50 - Katie Gibson : I think you'll want to contact either Mark Shores. He's the librarian who created that research guide. 
12:08:07 - Katie Gibson : He'll probably have more ideas of search strategy that can help you out
12:08:10 - Patron : I am getting some articles from Google scholars.
12:08:17 - Katie Gibson : I'm not finding anything in my Latin American Studies resources
12:09:05 - Katie Gibson : His contact information is: shoresml@miamioh.edu
12:09:44 - Patron : Thanks!. I am good. I was able to get some articles from google scholars

17:53:56 - Abigail Morgan : For the last one, yes, that is standard practice
17:54:06 - Abigail Morgan : where is this being published?
17:54:10 - Patron : normal citations should be ok?
17:55:06 - Abigail Morgan : Normal citation for the image should be fine
17:55:11 - Patron : i can double check the book, it was from the special collections in the Cincinnati library
17:55:54 - Patron : oh my thesis will be published to ohio link
17:55:58 - Abigail Morgan : oh, i meant, where is your thesis being published. the standard is just to treat it like a typical print publication (even if it is a born digital document that will probably only be read as a PDF)
17:56:07 - Abigail Morgan : ok got it
17:56:20 - Patron : Yes sorry, it will also be printed and kept in the department office
17:56:33 - Abigail Morgan : also i think if you are including captions then you don't need to include alt text because that would be redundant information for screen readers
17:56:58 - Abigail Morgan : as long as your caption is thorough, obviously
17:57:07 - Patron : okay! i was pretty sure that was the answer, but i wanted to be sure!
17:57:30 - Patron : yes, my alt text is essentially the same
17:57:46 - Abigail Morgan : then yeah, you shouldn't need both

18:21:54 - Abigail Morgan : What citation style are you using?
18:22:13 - Patron : APA
18:22:35 - Abigail Morgan : Thanks. What questions do you have?
18:24:12 - Patron : There is a lot, so I apologize. First one would be about a pdf I found. There is this app that lets you train virtual rats, and I found a pdf on how to use it. It came from another university as directions for a lab they had. Is that something I need to create a citation for?
18:24:56 - Abigail Morgan : Are you just using the instructions for your own research? Or do you actually reference the pdf in your paper?
18:25:40 - Patron : Its a presentation
18:26:05 - Patron : I was going to do it in front of the class for our classpartipation component
18:26:13 - Abigail Morgan : OK, I see
18:27:00 - Abigail Morgan : I guess the question still applies. Like, you wouldn't reference talking to me about how to cite something. So if you just use the pdf for directions you don't need to cite it. Does that make sense?
18:27:21 - Patron : But if I mention something that the pdf says, I would?
18:28:15 - Abigail Morgan : Sorry this is such a murky answer, but context really matters here. It depends. What are you going to mention about the pdf?
18:29:23 - Patron : I guess just the directions?
18:29:29 - Abigail Morgan : When in doubt, cite it
18:29:33 - Abigail Morgan : is the easy answer

18:32:46 - Abigail Morgan : I would cite it like this, as a report
18:32:55 - Patron : Okay. Just exactly like that?
18:34:20 - Abigail Morgan : You will need to make the hanging indent if needed
18:34:22 - Abigail Morgan : McAndrew, F. T. (n.d.). <em>Psychology 100 Instructions for Sniffy the Virtual Rat Operant Conditioning Lab</em>. <a href=""https://staff.knox.edu/fmcandre/sniffy.pdf"" target=""_blank"">https://staff.knox.edu/fmcandre/sniffy.pdf</a>
18:34:43 - Abigail Morgan : that would be the citation if you felt comfortable attributing the author
18:34:50 - Patron : Okay cool!
18:34:56 - Patron : Can I ask another question?
18:35:00 - Abigail Morgan : sure!
18:36:35 - Patron : So, for a lot of my articles, there is citations in the paper (which is common). At what point do I need to cite those as well? For example they cite an article and then tell the story the article was about.
18:37:06 - Patron : attached a file: <a href=""https://libanswers.lib.miamioh.edu/chat_file.php?i=1286&amp;f=442284&amp;preview=true"" target=""_blank"" class=""s-la-cfile"" data-preview=""inline"">https://libanswers.lib.miamioh.edu/chat_file.php?i=1286&amp;f=442284&amp;preview=true</a>
18:37:08 - Patron : Like this
18:39:10 - Abigail Morgan : Right. So in the best case scenario, a researcher would go and read those other papers and then write their own summaries. But in this instance, if you want to use the same examples, it is ok if you just cite the author of this one paper since you are just doing an in-class presentation I think
18:40:05 - Abigail Morgan : You can say ""author X described earlier studies and this is how they compared to theirs, etc...""
18:41:47 - Patron : attached a file: <a href=""https://libanswers.lib.miamioh.edu/chat_file.php?i=1286&amp;f=442286&amp;preview=true"" target=""_blank"" class=""s-la-cfile"" data-preview=""inline"">https://libanswers.lib.miamioh.edu/chat_file.php?i=1286&amp;f=442286&amp;preview=true</a>

18:42:57 - Patron : Okay! So in examples like these where they mention a bunch of studies that they drew information from, or studies that have used the methods they mentioned, I only cite the main article?
18:44:12 - Patron : attached a file: <a href=""https://libanswers.lib.miamioh.edu/chat_file.php?i=1286&amp;f=442290&amp;preview=true"" target=""_blank"" class=""s-la-cfile"" data-preview=""inline"">https://libanswers.lib.miamioh.edu/chat_file.php?i=1286&amp;f=442290&amp;preview=true</a>
18:44:36 - Patron : Or in like this one where they say ""in summary,"" and say what happens in a bunch of articles
18:44:38 - Abigail Morgan : Yes, if this is an overview or literature review article on mice studies, it is fine to just cite this main article. The rules are different if you are writing a paper, but since this is a spoken presentation it is easier to understand if you just cite one person
18:45:35 - Patron : Yeah its just like an overview presentation on what stuff like operant conditioning and ICSS is and then some examples of when they have been used
18:48:15 - Abigail Morgan : Did your instructor give you a specific number of sources to use?
18:48:27 - Patron : No
18:48:49 - Patron : I just get nervous about this stuff- I don't want to be academically dishonest and get in trouble and stuff
18:48:58 - Abigail Morgan : Sure, I get that
18:49:12 - Abigail Morgan : It is most honest to cite to the resource you actually used
18:50:24 - Abigail Morgan : So, in your presentation, if you have a slide or something - you can write on the slide - Latz and Kornesty did studies in 60s and 70s on mice...and then the citation is to this main article
18:51:34 - Abigail Morgan : you could even write...''As Author X summarized, Latz and Kornetsky did studies in the 60s and 70s...etc."" - then cite the main author
18:52:37 - Patron : Well since it's a presentation there isn't going to be a lot of full sentences. And some of the stuff has like a lot of sources? Like the ones that complie data from many sources or reference a study that used the method.
18:53:27 - Abigail Morgan : Yeah, for those I would look in the title - are they called like 'a systematic review' or 'overview' or something like that?
18:54:30 - Abigail Morgan : If so, then you can just say 'there was a review study conducted on mice operant conditioning and they found overall that...whatever' 
18:55:32 - Patron : But if they are referencing a specific study instead of a bunch of them/giving examples of studies that use them, I should cite the other article as well?
18:58:05 - Abigail Morgan : If the goal of the presentation is to give your audience resources about where to find studies on this topic, then it would be appropriate to cite it. it is kind of a gray area
18:58:54 - Patron : No, that's not the goal per se, but I can still cite them

19:00:26 - Patron : What about for this where they have a citation about the interpretation of the results? It tells what the results mean- like that over 10 is highly predicitve or whatever that the other people came up with (I think?)
19:01:03 - Abigail Morgan : This might help answer that question: <a href=""https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/apa7/indirect-cite"" target=""_blank"">https://guides.library.uq.edu.au/referencing/apa7/indirect-cite</a>
19:01:29 - Abigail Morgan : But yes, methodology does have to be cited
19:02:09 - Patron : I know about indirect citations, but the ""as cited in"" part is only for in-text citations, which we aren't doing in this
19:02:59 - Patron : attached a file: <a href=""https://libanswers.lib.miamioh.edu/chat_file.php?i=1286&amp;f=442305&amp;preview=true"" target=""_blank"" class=""s-la-cfile"" data-preview=""inline"">https://libanswers.lib.miamioh.edu/chat_file.php?i=1286&amp;f=442305&amp;preview=true</a>
19:03:10 - Patron : What about if I want to say ""aggression is seen in many mental disorders"" from this? Are all those articles cited?
19:05:15 - Abigail Morgan : The guidance from APA is that you only cite the article that you actually read or referred to on the reference list. You can discuss all the other authors/studies in the presentation, but you wouldn't cite them individually. 
19:06:23 - Abigail Morgan : I hope that helps, sorry it took so long to be succinct. 
19:06:33 - Patron : It's okay! There's a lot of questions.
19:07:03 - Patron : So I have to put on individual slides if I am mentioning articles that the main article is talking about?
19:11:33 - Abigail Morgan : My answer depends on the length of this presentation. If it is a long one and you are going to have lots of slides, then yes, I would do that. But if it is like 5 slides or less I would just put a reference list at the end
19:12:12 - Patron : But if there's many articles referencing a single point don't put individual articles
19:13:54 - Abigail Morgan : Right, just put the main article that lists them all
19:15:08 - Patron : Ok. One more question- if I am getting a defintion from an article, can I use the same word as them? For negative punishment/reinforcement, the word they use is ""avoid"" and that really is the best way to phrase it.
19:15:12 - Patron : Just like that single word
19:17:02 - Abigail Morgan : Yes, I would maybe say during that part of the presentation pretty much what you just wrote here - that avoid is the best word to use
19:17:18 - Abigail Morgan : and obviously cite that article :D
19:17:37 - Patron : Right. But no quotation marks or anything?
19:18:05 - Abigail Morgan : If the word is on the slide itself you can put quotation marks around it
19:18:22 - Patron : I didn't think you needed to do that for single words
19:18:37 - Abigail Morgan : if it is a key word then yes
19:18:51 - Abigail Morgan : it is sort of like emphasizing it
19:19:19 - Patron : Okay. Thank you for your help! I really appreciate you answering all my questions
19:19:26 - Abigail Morgan : You are very welcome!!

09:08:45 - Kristen Adams : this give you guidance on doing the in-text citations and the bibliography
09:09:52 - Patron : I don't know if there is something specifically for a pdf though. Would it count as like a website? It says on the bottom it was presented in something, but I don't know if it's a journal or magazine or something

09:09:58 - Patron : Here's what it looks like
09:10:56 - Kristen Adams : well the citation guidance is different for articles or book chapters - PDFs aren't all the same
09:11:12 - Kristen Adams : this looks like it could be either a book chapter or an article from a journal
09:11:25 - Kristen Adams : let me do some searching and see if we can figure it out
09:11:53 - Kristen Adams : because if it's a journal, we'll need the journal name, and for a book chapter, we'll need the book title
09:12:15 - Patron : okay
09:13:15 - Kristen Adams : Google Scholar is really helpful in these cases, I searched for the title and author, and found more info
09:13:16 - Kristen Adams : McSweeney, F. K. (1999). Making sense of animal conditioning. <i>Grazing Behavior of Livestock and Wildlife. Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Exp. Sta. Bull</i>, <i>70</i>.
09:14:10 - Kristen Adams : looks like it's a government document, from the Idaho Forest Wildlife and Rage State Bulletin. 
09:14:13 - Patron : Oh okay. So use that?
09:14:19 - Kristen Adams : and that's in APA - yes
09:14:23 - Patron : yes!
09:14:30 - Kristen Adams : <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=making+sense+of+animal+conditioning+mcsweeney&amp;inst=16988007086065176396&amp;submit=+"" target=""_blank"">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=making+sense+of+animal+conditioning+mcsweeney&amp;inst=16988007086065176396&amp;submit=+</a>
09:14:50 - Kristen Adams : here's the search I did, and you click 'cite' and it give you all this and lets you choose which style
09:15:02 - Kristen Adams : APA is a big one, so they had that
09:15:09 - Patron : Perfect! Thanks so much!
09:15:23 - Kristen Adams : I would check that first guide I sent though so you know how to cite it in the text
09:15:37 - Kristen Adams : this citation is good for the bibliography 
09:16:22 - Kristen Adams : hang on, I just noticed that there's no page numbers to that citation that Google generated.
09:16:31 - Kristen Adams : You'll probably need to add those
09:16:55 - Kristen Adams : I'm fairly sure that APA wants the page numbers added to the citation, and you can just get those from the PDF you have
09:17:01 - Patron : okay!
09:18:28 - Kristen Adams : glad to help
09:19:20 - Patron : McSweeney, F. K. (1999). Making sense of animal conditioning. Grazing Behavior of Livestock and Wildlife. Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Exp. Sta. Bull, 70. 13-19.
09:19:37 - Patron : Like that? But with the parts indented?
09:19:49 - Patron : Or italized sorry
09:20:15 - Patron : Also, should there be a link after it?
09:21:01 - Kristen Adams : let me check it...
09:21:56 - Kristen Adams : italics on the 'Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Exp.' - as that's the journal name - yes
09:22:17 - Kristen Adams : then a comma rather than a period after 70 before the page numbers
09:22:27 - Kristen Adams : otherwise I think it looks good
09:22:59 - Kristen Adams : McSweeney, F. K. (1999). Making sense of animal conditioning. Grazing Behavior of Livestock and Wildlife. <i>Idaho Forest, Wildlife and Range Exp. Sta. Bull</i>, 70, 13-19.
09:23:17 - Kristen Adams : I don't think the link is necessary
09:23:46 - Kristen Adams : you can add it if want, or check with your professor - but I don't see in the guidance that it's required

You can find a few outlined here if you're interested, in the ""Why Embargo a Thesis or Dissertation?"" section of the LibGuide: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.fit.edu/formattingyourthesisanddissertationtoolstipstroubleshooting/doineedtoembargomythesisordissertation#:~:text=In%20academia%2C%20an%20%22embargo%22,a%20limited%20period%20of%20time"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.fit.edu/formattingyourthesisanddissertationtoolstipstroubleshooting/doineedtoembargomythesisordissertation#:~:text=In%20academia%2C%20an%20%22embargo%22,a%20limited%20period%20of%20time</a>.

12:23:20 - Laura Birkenhauer : By the way, I noticed that this is a University of Miami scholar. Did you know you are chatting with Miami University, in Ohio? 
12:23:58 - Laura Birkenhauer : If you'd like to connect with the University of Miami, I can share their Libraries information. If you aren't affiliated with Miami University, the interlibrary loan option unfortunately won't work for you.
12:24:27 - Laura Birkenhauer : Your best bet is to connect with your local library - public, school, academic, or otherwise! And they'll do their best to access this for you!
12:24:57 - Patron : No I thought I was talking with Univ of Miami So sorry.
12:25:28 - Laura Birkenhauer : No problem, it happens more often than you think! Here is their Ask A Librarian page: <a href=""https://www.library.miami.edu/research/ask-a-librarian.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.library.miami.edu/research/ask-a-librarian.html</a>

11:19:34 - Patron : no, not published, it was for a module we did at Uni, but I am allowed to cite it. I have used Apa 7th for my references. I thought it was Harvard. I confused you, sorry.
11:20:00 - Kristen Adams : I see. Ok. Let me pull up the APA guidance.

11:20:14 - Kristen Adams : and I might need to check the book - I have a hard copy here.
11:20:18 - Kristen Adams : hang on,

11:25:50 - Kristen Adams : if you don't have a URL, then you just don't and I'd leave it off
11:26:27 - Patron : ok.
11:26:42 - Patron : what is meant by the deparment name?

11:27:32 - Kristen Adams : it's a template for a variety of unpublished works
11:28:12 - Kristen Adams : I think earlier you told me who it was delivered by, I'd probably use that
11:28:40 - Patron : I have found it
11:28:46 - Kristen Adams : or the name of the university

13:05:38 - Patron : Am I able to borrow the book from libraries outside of OH through Worldcat?

13:07:20 - Patron : I requested the book from Lilliad.
13:07:33 - Patron : ILLiad.
13:08:15 - Patron : I'm in the process of borrowing the book from UC via OhioLink. I don't need the book until August. What do you suggest?
13:08:48 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I would probably wait to request the book if you don't need it until August. 
13:09:00 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Are you hoping to have it for the whole semester? 
13:09:03 - Patron : Yes.
13:09:59 - Jaclyn Spraetz : There are checkout time limits for books through OhioLINK and Illiad. I would say OhioLINK might be a little more forgiving with renewals but it really depends on if someone else wants to borrow it. 
13:10:37 - Patron : Ok. I'll just wait and hopefully, it will be available in August. Thank you for your help.
13:11:04 - Jaclyn Spraetz : You may want to check with Abi Morgan who is the business librarian and purchases books for this collection. She may be able to purchase a copy for our library

I have tried looking in the BUS 102/FYIC homepage but I have not found anything regarding these questions.
11:43:00 - Barry Zaslow : OK. Have you tried using Business Source Complete under Databases A-Z on the library home page? You can put some search terms in the boxes there such as ""fuel industry"" combined with ""deliver"" and you can also limit to a range of years such as 2010-2020 as well as English language. Another database that might be useful is called Environment Complete. They both use the same interface. Does this sound helpful?
11:43:49 - Patron : Yes thank you
11:44:29 - Barry Zaslow : You could also limit to the type of fuel, for example coal, oil, gasoline. I did some sample searches without specific limits and got a lot of matches so it would be beneficial to narrow it down (perhaps also by country)
11:45:05 - Patron : Thank you
11:46:56 - Barry Zaslow : Also both the business librarians Abi and Zac are scheduled to be on chat this afternoon from 3-6pm if you want to try them for more advice later. At least give the two databases some attempts first, though. Their e-mails are morgan55@miamioh.edu and grishaz@miamioh.edu if you are really stuck.

12:33:35 - Laura Birkenhauer : I am not familiar with that second source, but I'm looking around a bit. I will say.. if you're able to wait until 3 pm, BOTH of our Business Librarians will be staffing this chat service until 5 pm! They would be the subject experts in this area and your best bet for a good explanation and further help. Would that work for you?
12:34:56 - Patron : Yes that would work
12:35:24 - Laura Birkenhauer : Sounds good. Their names are Zac and Abi, so when you chat later you'll be assigned to one of the two of them and they'll be very helpful with this!

13:39:17 - Zachary Grisham : Oh, we can definitely do that. 
13:39:39 - Patron : is there a specific database?
13:39:39 - Zachary Grisham : So are you looking for an academic article, trade article, popular magazine, news, etc.
13:39:47 - Zachary Grisham : Depends on what you are looking for.
13:40:01 - Patron : news magazine like time or maybe a wsj article
13:40:09 - Zachary Grisham : Yep, I can help you with that.
13:40:24 - Patron : the only thing is it has to be a physical copy
13:40:43 - Zachary Grisham : Oh, well that makes it a bit more difficult. 
13:40:56 - Zachary Grisham : We might still be able to find it though.
13:41:13 - Zachary Grisham : So, you cant search physical copies by keyword search.
13:41:37 - Zachary Grisham : Maybe we can look for digital copies then see if we have them in the physical collection as well?
13:41:50 - Patron : ok that works

13:42:54 - Patron : I tried but wound up on a database for eastern European magazines
13:43:38 - Zachary Grisham : You then can limit by what type of resource you want on the left hand side

13:45:00 - Zachary Grisham : You could also take a look at the database opposing viewpoints.

13:50:39 - Zachary Grisham : What about a book?
13:50:47 - Patron : that could work
13:50:50 - Zachary Grisham : Ok. One second.
13:52:14 - Zachary Grisham : Well, even the books on the topic are online. 
13:52:39 - Zachary Grisham : We can see what magazines and newspapers we have in print.
13:52:48 - Zachary Grisham : Let me take a deeper dive on books though.
13:52:52 - Patron : that sounds good
13:55:35 - Zachary Grisham : So, it looks like we do have some print books on it. 
13:56:02 - Zachary Grisham : We also have some newspapers downstairs but the print ones are not searchable via the library search tool.
13:56:42 - Zachary Grisham : We could use say, new york times.com or the wall street journal to see if there were any new articles on it and then see if we have a print counterpart downstairs. 
13:56:57 - Zachary Grisham : I would just need to ask the circulation folks how long we keep newspapers.
13:57:14 - Patron : sounds good
13:57:30 - Zachary Grisham : Which one? Looking in the stacks for a book or asking about the newspapers?
13:58:19 - Patron : newspapers I guess the issue is books are longer and I don't have time to read a whole one
13:58:42 - Zachary Grisham : It would likely only be a chapter. However, we can explore the newspaper stuff real quick.
13:58:52 - Zachary Grisham : Alright, I will call the folks downstairs.
13:58:54 - Zachary Grisham : brb
14:01:52 - Zachary Grisham : Hey Micah, turns out our print newspaper collections only go around three months back.
14:02:06 - Zachary Grisham : So we can try searching that and see if it works out for us.
14:02:14 - Zachary Grisham : Do you know how to search the NY Times?
14:02:22 - Zachary Grisham : Have you done it before?
14:02:29 - Patron : yes
14:02:48 - Zachary Grisham : Great, you can search that then limit it to the past 3 months.
14:02:49 - Patron : give me second and I can start looking
14:02:56 - Zachary Grisham : Sounds good, I will as well.
14:05:05 - Patron : I found something just need to see if it got put in the paper or just online
14:05:14 - Zachary Grisham : Perfect!
14:08:07 - Patron : I found something in the paper going to start reading and see if its a good fit thank you for the help.

Have you done any searching yet? We have a lot of resources in print at the Music Library and also there are some indexes for Music under Databases A-Z on the library home page. If you are able to use print then doing a search in the catalog under Books and More for the subject ""Jazz"" you can limit to years such as 1931-1940 or 1941-1950 to get titles. There is also a database called Jazz Music Library where you can both listen by audio streaming and find some notes about the recordings. Does any of this sound useful?
12:04:29 - Barry Zaslow : Here is one likely title called Pearl Harbor Jazz at Music Library in ML 3918 .J39 T7 2007
12:05:01 - Patron : I have done some researching but couldn't find any that were downloadable or printed
12:06:32 - Barry Zaslow : If you are on campus or nearby I would suggest going to Music for books at least. The two indexes that might have some full-text are Music Index Online and RILM Abstracts both in Databases A-Z. 
12:07:16 - Patron : okay! thank you so much!
12:10:35 - Barry Zaslow : You're welcome. Play around with search terms, too. They might use ""African American or ""Afro-American"". You could also go to the Oxford Music Online database and see if you get any performers names for that time period (for example Louis Armstrong, Fats Waller, Duke Ellington, Count Basie would have been active then)
12:13:54 - Barry Zaslow : I'm signing off chat now but there are other chat staffers here till 9pm.If you need further assistance send me an e-mail at zaslowbj@miamioh.edu since music is my subject area, but please try some of the above first.

12:45:08 - Stefanie Hilles : Yeah. We don't have a copy. You can contact your librarian to purchase it though.
12:45:25 - Stefanie Hilles : It's not even in OhioLINK. Probably since it was just published
12:45:38 - Patron : Thanks! I'll check with my co-authors and editors as well - hope that's not too shady
12:46:10 - Stefanie Hilles : I don't think so!
12:46:36 - Patron : AIP tried to give me access - I also emailed their Scitation team, and will see if that helps. Thanks for checking on this for me!
12:46:53 - Stefanie Hilles : No problem! Sorry I couldn't be of more help...
12:47:07 - Stefanie Hilles : That being said, is there anything else I can help you with today?
12:47:19 - Patron : I think I'm good. Thanks, Stefanie!

12:47:08 - Patron : I think I am looking more into the first-year college student's experiences with inclusive education I have changed my argument a little bit since I first started so its a little confusing at the moment sorry!
12:47:36 - Jaclyn Spraetz : That's no problem at all! Definitely happens as you work through the research
12:48:00 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Do any of these sources look like they will be helpful to you? A database that is great is ERIC: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/eric-ebscohost"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/eric-ebscohost</a>
12:51:18 - Patron : yes, I think I can use a lot of the information, especially with the college transition thank you!
12:51:47 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Great! You're welcome! Let me know if I can answer any other questions you have

I contacted this morning about Adobe Creative Cloud. I need a format check for my thesis by April 7, and I see that every Adobe Creative Cloud is all checked out.

13:46:00 - Ginny Boehme : Which library did you go to?
13:46:06 - Patron : King
13:46:18 - Ginny Boehme : Ok, let me check to see what I can find, please hold
13:46:25 - Patron : Thank you!
13:49:29 - Ginny Boehme : Ok, so I'm not seeing any info about the laptops having Creative Cloud. I'm not sure who told you this. It's possible that some of the laptops at the Wertz Art and Architecture Library have the suite, but you may want to call and check. If the laptops don't have it, then your best option is to use the desktop computers in either library, they should have CC
13:50:09 - Ginny Boehme : Phone: 513-529-6638<br />
13:50:15 - Ginny Boehme : there's the number for Wertz
13:50:23 - Patron : Think that’s what the person may have meant then. Possibly the desktops.
13:50:30 - Ginny Boehme : Very possible
13:50:37 - Patron : Thank you so much I will go ahead and call!
13:50:41 - Ginny Boehme : I think it's too expensive to maintain on the laptops
13:50:46 - Ginny Boehme : You're welcome, and good luck!

10:17:51 - Katie Gibson : Can you explain what you're clicking when you see the error?
10:18:31 - Patron : I am clicking ""find it"" on the leftmost side of the screen. Usually when I click this, I am redirected to multiple options that allow me to download a pdf of the article. However, now it is not allowing me to view the article at all.
10:18:50 - Patron : A System Problem has Occurred.	
	
We're sorry, your request could not be processed due an internal server error.
To continue with your session, please click here.
10:19:01 - Patron : ^^^This is the message I keep getting
10:19:02 - Katie Gibson : Hm, yes, that's how it should be working... can you please send the information to the article you're trying to access?
10:19:22 - Katie Gibson : It might be an issue we have to report to our e-resources team, so I want to try to replicate what's going on
10:19:40 - Patron : There are multiple articles....probably around 10. This is happening for every article I have clicked, from different authors, journals, etc.
10:20:00 - Patron : Here is one of them:
10:20:00 - Katie Gibson : I just saw the same error when I tried to use the find it button on an article
10:20:19 - Katie Gibson : I think this is a general find it button issue that I'll report to our systems team to get fixed
10:20:22 - Patron : The multilingual origins of Standard English (Topics in English Linguistics 107) by Ana Mondejar-Perez
10:20:25 - Katie Gibson : thank you for letting us know about it!
10:20:51 - Katie Gibson : there is a way around this until we get it fixed
10:21:11 - Patron : No problem! And that's good, do you have an estimate on when it will be fixed? Today is the deadline for thesis format checks
10:21:20 - Katie Gibson : you can use the ejournals tab of the catalog to search for the journal that the article is in (so in this case, Topics in English Linguistics)
10:21:27 - Katie Gibson : and it will tell you which databases have the journal
10:21:38 - Katie Gibson : and then you can search that database for the article title
10:21:46 - Patron : Okay, and it will allow me to access it?
10:21:47 - Katie Gibson : it's more cumbersome, but it should get you to the same place
10:21:50 - Katie Gibson : it should
10:22:00 - Patron : Okay! Can I try before you leave to make sure?
10:22:02 - Katie Gibson : I'm going to try it with the article you just sent just to make sure
10:22:47 - Katie Gibson : ok, we don't have the journal Topics in English Linguistics

10:26:01 - Katie Gibson : ah, ok, so that's another we don't subscribe to
10:26:23 - Katie Gibson : and you can use the same request link to get it
10:26:51 - Katie Gibson : Taylor and Francis can be a frustrating interface because it looks like we have access when we don't d
10:27:03 - Katie Gibson : but you can request it and get it in a few days
10:27:14 - Patron : Okay. Last time I used a request it took two days to receive access. I don't have that kind of time this time around.
10:27:35 - Patron : If you report the EBSCO Host problem, will it be resolved immediately?
10:28:30 - Katie Gibson : I already have it reported. Hopefully, it will be a quick fix. But if we don't subscribe to the journal, the Find It button will run into the same problem. It will give you the request item link.

20:07:10 - Patron : Hello, I am trying to find an epidemiological study on the  salmonella chaile 2017 outbreak. My search came up with 3 results, that I think are MMWR reports and don't look like a study at all.
20:07:24 - Patron : Salmonella chailey
20:07:40 - Patron : It was in the US and Canada
20:07:51 - Patron : 19 cases, r/t coconut
20:08:00 - Ginny Boehme : can you tell me more about why they won't work? what are the requirements for your paper?
20:10:24 - Patron : Based on the case you selected, review the literature for an article related to this outbreak. The article should be an original study, in which authors analyzed epidemiological data and developed conclusions based on the data. This should not be a review of other studies. This part of your assignment should be around 2 pages, but not more than 2 pages single-spaced. The Finding Epidemiological Studies tab of the NSG 646 library research guide will help you find an original study about your selected outbreak.
20:10:49 - Patron : I am reading a case study, and from what I read, it reads just like the case study in the book
20:11:39 - Patron : I used the search terms: salmonella chailey and epidemi* or disease outbreaks
20:13:31 - Ginny Boehme : I'm not finding much on this either. Since there were only 19 cases, I'm guessing that there just wasn't much focus on this particular outbreak and so little was written about it. I might recommend that you try to select a different topic. Maybe a different salmonella outbreak?
20:15:00 - Ginny Boehme : Although this study from MMWR does look like an epidemiological study, just one without lots of data to report: <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6739a5.htm"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6739a5.htm</a>
20:15:16 - Patron : It has to be this particular case. I also have the option for Zika and measles, which may have more, though they are also particular cases too, also from 2017.
20:15:33 - Patron : Thank you for the link
20:15:51 - Patron : And for your help! I didn't realize you all were on this late.
20:15:54 - Ginny Boehme : I think you will have better luck finding more studies to analyze with either of the other two diseases, if that article will not work
20:16:11 - Ginny Boehme : You're welcome! We usually have someone on here until 9pm :)

10:19:34 - Barry Zaslow : OK. Is your e-mail griff116@miamioh.edu? If so I will place the hold and indicate King as a pickup location. They usually go over to BEST once a day so it might not be till Monday but you should get an e-mail notice that it's ready.
10:20:04 - Patron : yes that is my email and that would be great thank you so much
10:20:15 - Barry Zaslow : Sure. Anything else at this time?
10:20:27 - Patron : no all good! thanks again
10:20:38 - Barry Zaslow : Have a great day!

11:00:04 - Jenny Presnell : Unofficially, the third floor is supposed to be quieter
11:00:20 - Jenny Presnell : especially that large study room

11:01:01 - Jenny Presnell : when everyone gets in the room
11:01:24 - Jenny Presnell : also
11:01:44 - Patron : Yeah! I study in the third floor large room almost every day, but I have just noticed that it has gotten a louder with staff conversations in front of the elevators and various activities and I wasn't sure if that was temporary!
11:01:50 - Jenny Presnell : the Music library and the Art Arch library are very quiet and music
11:02:01 - Jenny Presnell : has a large sunny window on the balcon
11:02:05 - Jenny Presnell : balcony
11:02:41 - Jenny Presnell : We have had a series of interviews, so hopefully this is temporary
11:02:52 - Jenny Presnell : does the study room have a door to close? I forget
11:03:38 - Jenny Presnell : Still, when I need to ""hide"" to get something done -- 2nd floor carrels by the windows -- or I hike to the Music Library

16:25:13 - Zachary Grisham : On that journal

16:32:37 - Zachary Grisham : Here you go, that will give you access to the journal
16:32:46 - Zachary Grisham : We have from 2002 until 2022
16:33:08 - Zachary Grisham : I will look for the second one now.
16:33:28 - Patron : Thanks!
16:34:36 - Patron : is the 2002 one the same name and author?
16:34:45 - Zachary Grisham : Nope, that is my point. 
16:35:02 - Zachary Grisham : The library does not have direct access to anything before 2002
16:35:11 - Zachary Grisham : The article you were referring to was from 96
16:35:20 - Zachary Grisham : From that journal
16:35:59 - Zachary Grisham : Interesting.
16:36:11 - Zachary Grisham : Are these articles from chat GPT or something like that?
16:36:35 - Zachary Grisham : I believe I found the journal where the second one was supposed to be, but it is called something else.

16:37:55 - Zachary Grisham : But there might be more than one journal with this name
16:38:09 - Zachary Grisham : Will look. :)
16:38:15 - Patron : I'm not sure. I got them from class notes a while ago.
16:38:30 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, is there a possibility that the citation was wrong?
16:38:37 - Patron : But I cannot see the authors for the second one either.

16:39:15 - Patron : I am trying to cite for the theory of Teaching-learning cycle.
16:39:33 - Patron : I will double check with my professor on the citations.
16:40:21 - Zachary Grisham : Ok! Please do, either way. If we do not have access you can request them via ILL. If they exist a request will be sent out to a university that has them and we can have them sent to your email.
16:40:40 - Patron : Thanks!
16:41:15 - Patron : Can i ask a quick question?
16:41:19 - Zachary Grisham : Of course!
16:41:23 - Patron : about APA formating
16:41:28 - Zachary Grisham : Yep, happy to help.

16:41:40 - Zachary Grisham : It will allow you to request your articles.
16:41:50 - Patron : what does ""spacing"" mean?
16:42:06 - Patron : My professor left a marginal comment saying ""spacing""
16:42:30 - Patron : does it mean space between two words or letters? There is no other meaning, right?
16:43:10 - Zachary Grisham : It most likely means your spacing was not in line with APA format.
16:43:23 - Zachary Grisham : Give me a moment and I will send you a link to an example APA paper. 
16:43:32 - Zachary Grisham : What edition does your professor want?
16:43:58 - Patron : most updated?
16:44:13 - Zachary Grisham : Sounds good. :)
16:44:18 - Zachary Grisham : Some folks like older styles
16:44:27 - Zachary Grisham : One moment and I shall get it for you.

12:45:34 - Patron : Well--I'm building a barn. And I'm interested in timberframing technique. But also the history of timberframing. Their doesn't seem to be an exhaustive historical reference for this beautiful work. So I'm giving it a shot.
12:46:18 - Ginny Boehme : ok let me see what I can find
12:46:29 - Patron : de Navarre--I'm interested in his relationship with the Albigensian crusades.

10:10:38 - Patron : do you think you could help me find sources from states that already have this legislation?
10:11:49 - Nate Floyd : So, we're not worried about ""insight into the time it takes for a state bill to become law"" ?
10:12:11 - Nate Floyd : I'm not clear on ""student id as a voter id bill"" 
10:12:16 - Nate Floyd : Can you say more about that? 
10:13:59 - Patron : After photo ID laws have been passed statewide in states like Alabama, Alaska, Wisconsin, Georgia, etc., amendments have been made to the bill that have included student ids as a form of acceptable ID to vote with. I'm looking for a source that shares more on the timeline from when the photo ID bill became a law to when the student id amendment was added
10:16:26 - Nate Floyd : I think it will be hard to nail down a timeline, because state politics is just so partisan and unpredictable. That said, I think you probably want to reach out to our Political Science librarian. Her name is Jenny Presnell. Her email presnejl@miamioh.edu. She will be able to help much more quickly than me. I've got several other questions going on chat reference right now :( 
10:17:32 - Patron : thank you for your help and her contact information!

17:33:55 - Zachary Grisham : Well, I am automatically logged in on campus so I cannot see what you are seeing. Let me try to use a private browser to troubleshoot with you.

Your sign-in was successful but does not meet the criteria to access this resource. For example, you might be signing in from a browser, app, or location that is restricted by your admin.

17:35:18 - Zachary Grisham : Changing the logo to MU is the right step though.
17:35:27 - Zachary Grisham : Step in the right direction though.
17:35:39 - Zachary Grisham : Are you trying to access the PDF?
17:36:11 - Patron : yes.  I have 41 projects that submitted standards (2 each) if we can't resolve this, I'll do it on campus tomorrow.

16:55:22 - Patron : i think most if not all students know that this floor is the quietest as there is a cafe on the ground floor and study rooms on the first and second, encouraging group work, where as the third floor doesn't have that ,so it's just stressful as a student to feel like there isn't anywhere that is guaranteed to be quiet
16:56:40 - Jenny Presnell : Third floor just doesn't have as much study space as 2nd floor -- my office is on the second floor and right now its really quiet
16:57:03 - Jenny Presnell : no one thinks to go into the children's area either and then back by gov docs
16:57:25 - Patron : where is the childrens area? the 2nd floor?
16:57:25 - Jenny Presnell : with the Makerspace on 3rd floor it just won't be quiet
16:57:28 - Jenny Presnell : no
16:57:50 - Jenny Presnell : behind the cafe in the double doors and then go back to the compact shelving on the right
16:57:58 - Jenny Presnell : that's the gov docs collection
16:58:00 - Patron : got it

11:53:25 - Roger Justus : or Newspapers.com is one area I would look in, given that this is a specific camp in the YMCA system you may also want to try to contact them as well, they may have or offer stuff as well
11:53:38 - Roger Justus : you may have done that already...
11:53:51 - Roger Justus : Here is somthing I found just searching google.   <a href=""https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VjBAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=D1kMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3875%2C2591361"" target=""_blank"">https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VjBAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=D1kMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3875%2C2591361</a>
11:54:06 - Patron : I fortunately work there so I know a lot about it, just wanted to look deeper into the history!
11:54:19 - Roger Justus : Ha! Ok that is great, sounds like a very fun project!
11:54:38 - Roger Justus : Local historical agencies would also be good.
11:54:52 - Patron : perfect, thank you so much.  I think that is all I needed!

14:03:57 - Patron : Hello! I was just on here (I think with you) about citing an instruction pdf (https://s3.amazonaws.com/alpco-docs/11/11-CORHU-E01-SLV.pdf). I was given a website to help (https://libguides.umgc.edu/c.php?g=1003870&amp;p=7270670) but I am confused as to if  the pdf has a publication number
14:05:31 - Mark Dahlquist : Hmm, I see. Yes I did provide that link before. It looks like the publication number is optional to include. Here is another example I found...<br />
14:05:55 - Mark Dahlquist : Report by a Government Agency or Other Organization

<p>Organization Name. (Year). <em>Title of report. </em>URL</p>


<p>United States Government Accountability Office. (2019). <em>Performance and accountability report: Fiscal year 2019</em>. <a href=""https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/702715.pdf""><a href=""https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/702715.pdf"" target=""_blank"">https://www.gao.gov/assets/710/702715.pdf</a></a></p>


<br />
14:06:14 - Mark Dahlquist : This citation example comes from Purdue OWL: <a href=""https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/reference_list_other_print_sources.html"" target=""_blank"">https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/reference_list_other_print_sources.html</a><br />
14:06:26 - Patron : The pdf has a ""catalog number"". Is that the same thing?
14:10:09 - Mark Dahlquist : I'm not sure, but it looks like the catalog number may be a number assigned by APLCO as a way of keeping track of its various catalogs. I would say you could include this number, (Catalog No. 
11-CORHU-E01-SLV), but it might not be needed since you have the URL.<br />
14:10:49 - Mark Dahlquist : It looks like the catalog no is a internal number assigned by ALPCO for tracking its various publications.<br />
14:12:00 - Patron : Okay. And would ALPCO be listed as the author? Would that be just ALPCO all caps?
14:13:45 - Mark Dahlquist : Yes, since no names of individuals are given, you would need to have a corporate author. Hold on and I will check about all caps....<br />
14:14:52 - Patron : On their website they are all caps as well, which to me applies that it is an acroynm, but I can't find anything that says what that acroynym could be
14:15:22 - Mark Dahlquist : Yes, that's a little tricky. I'll see if I can find something on this.<br />
14:20:00 - Mark Dahlquist : According to this guide you can leave this in all-caps: <a href=""https://libguides.up.edu/apa/government-legal"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.up.edu/apa/government-legal</a><br />
14:20:56 - Mark Dahlquist : This uses the example of ASPCA which should also apply to ALPCO.<br />

Do you know how to reference video game assets?

I've had to use them for an computer science assignment and can't find a way to reference them using APA.

The assets consist of large collections of images","","11","","11:49:52 - Barry Zaslow : Hello. Have you looked at the guides under Citation Resources on the library home page? There are some good APA examples (I would suggest this section: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/citation/apa_multimedia-examples"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/citation/apa_multimedia-examples</a>
11:52:06 - Patron : I have. The images are game assets, perhaps 30+ per collection. I am not sure how to reference them as a collection. I can only find examples of single images that are referenced as 'figures'.

Unfortunately, I can't reference them as figures as they are moving objects in a game
11:55:17 - Barry Zaslow : It looks like many of the examples there use a brief word or phrase in brackets--perhaps you could use [video asset] when you describe the item (assuming it tells you who created it, etc.) Does this help? 
11:56:25 - Patron : Oh i can create my own category?
11:56:41 - Patron : if so, then yes, that definitely helps
11:57:25 - Barry Zaslow : I'm not an APA expert by any means nor do I have much experience with gaming. If you are truly flummoxed I suggest contacting Nate Floyd at floydns@miamioh.edu or Megan Jaskowiak at jaskowma@miamioh.edu. These two librarians are much more conversant with APA (he does a lot with e-sports and she is the APA trainer for us)
11:58:21 - Barry Zaslow : They might be able to say whether it is possible to ""create your own category"" too
11:59:04 - Patron : Ok, I appreciate your help.

I am not a student at Miami, so I won't take up any more staff time, but thank you for the suggestion
11:59:41 - Barry Zaslow : They might not mind getting non-affiliated questions. We all help people around the world when we have time/something to share.
12:00:19 - Patron : Ok. I will follow your suggestion and contact one of the people you listed. Thank you again for your help
12:00:38 - Barry Zaslow : You're welcome. Hope it works out well.

17:12:28 - Zachary Grisham : Did that bring you to the journal?
17:13:47 - Patron : No, it brought me to EBSCO, to select a resource
17:14:01 - Zachary Grisham : <i>Of course, that is Ebsco for you.</i>
17:14:03 - Zachary Grisham : One moment.
17:17:26 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, do you know how to search specifically for journals?
17:17:37 - Zachary Grisham : Using the libraries website?
17:18:29 - Patron : I think so, but I wasn't able to find this article.  I tried that first.
17:18:48 - Zachary Grisham : Oh, did you already find the journal in the ejournal section?
17:18:54 - Zachary Grisham : Then look through those articles
17:18:56 - Patron : yes
17:19:13 - Zachary Grisham : Oh, did you find the volumes that were in February?
17:19:36 - Patron : my publication date may be too broad - I was looking from 2022 to 2023
17:19:41 - Patron : let me see if I can reduce it
17:20:16 - Patron : hmm that appears all I can do - is reduce by year
17:20:44 - Zachary Grisham : No worries, I can figure out when it was published. However, if you find the journal you can look through each volume.
17:20:49 - Zachary Grisham : That was what I was asking.
17:21:00 - Zachary Grisham : Let me go see if I can find the date really quick
17:21:20 - Patron : thanks!!
17:21:55 - Patron : Just FYI - I'm was searching in the Articles &amp; More...then ""the chronicles of philanthropy"" was my first search term
17:22:08 - Patron : I also tried typing in Forbes as a second search term but nothing pulled up
17:22:11 - Zachary Grisham : Ahh, there is an actual journal search
17:22:12 - Patron : perhaps I don't have the correct date
17:22:18 - Patron : ahh!
17:22:24 - Zachary Grisham : It was published February 14 2023
17:22:29 - Zachary Grisham : This is the paywall link
17:22:29 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://www.philanthropy.com/article/2022s-top-donors-forbes-400-and-giving-pledge-billionaires-who-gave-big"" target=""_blank"">https://www.philanthropy.com/article/2022s-top-donors-forbes-400-and-giving-pledge-billionaires-who-gave-big</a>
17:22:52 - Zachary Grisham : Instead of searching articles and more search ejournals
17:23:00 - Zachary Grisham : Then type in Chronicle of Philanthropy
17:23:04 - Zachary Grisham : It will pop up. 
17:23:15 - Zachary Grisham : Then on the right hand side you can see the different volumes.
17:23:19 - Patron : I will try that now
17:23:23 - Zachary Grisham : They will be seperated by month.
17:26:26 - Zachary Grisham : Ahah! I believe I found it.

17:29:02 - Zachary Grisham : Hey Sarah, can you let me know if that worked?
17:29:39 - Zachary Grisham : That should be the article btw, not just the journal.

12:41:26 - Patron : I just want it as correct as possible, before it is made into an actual policy and set in stone.
12:41:43 - Ginny Boehme : I think that makes sense. The main point of citations is so that someone else can find what you're citing, and the section information makes perfect sense, especially if it's an online resource with no page numbers
12:42:17 - Ginny Boehme : I might consider adding the section number as if it were a page number, if that makes sense
12:42:35 - Patron : There is a page, so should I use that instead? I'll take a picture of it

11:36:14 - Patron : Will try.  I tried this a bunch before and couldn't figure it out.

11:37:14 - Patron : I just requested it ands it's still waiting for approval.  And I immediately found out I don't need it.
11:37:58 - Patron : And that form on ILL does not seem to allow me to cancel it.  Is there an actual ILL staff member I can contact?
11:38:12 - Nate Floyd : Yes, you can email Sheila Sparks, who manages interlibrary loan requests. Her email is: sparkssk@miamioh.edu

13:31:06 - Stefanie Hilles : Oh! I think I read your question incorrectly. My apologies. You're looking for HAMILTON reserves, not Middletown?
13:31:23 - Patron : Yes, apologies about the confusion.
13:31:52 - Stefanie Hilles : No worries! I totally blame myself. I had some late airport travel yesterday. Let me look for the correct info this time :)

13:34:19 - Stefanie Hilles : I hope so!
13:34:29 - Stefanie Hilles : Is there anything else I can help you with today?
13:36:21 - Patron : No, thank you for asking. I was trying to paste the link into the correct spot before the chat closed.
13:36:45 - Stefanie Hilles : Oh! It won't close until one of us ends it. No rush!
13:39:34 - Patron : Ok. I have finally managed to copy the address and have the link go to the correct location.
13:40:17 - Patron : I'm new to actually having to create links, so it always takes me longer.
Thank you for your help and your patience as I tinkered with that.
13:40:47 - Stefanie Hilles : Absolutely! As I said, that's what we're here for :)
13:41:43 - Patron : A fact I appreciate. :) I hope you have a good rest of your day!
13:42:01 - Stefanie Hilles : You too! We're here until 6 on chat if you have any other questions :)

11:43:16 - Mark Dahlquist : So, I would say this article should be ok.<br />

11:48:49 - Mark Dahlquist : Sure! I would suggest that you begin by thinking about your topic and your initial vision for how your paper will be structured (thought this may change, of course). I would then think about what sorts of information you will need to create your paper (points of view, historical data, etc, including varied points of view). Then I would <br />
11:49:01 - Mark Dahlquist : go about searching for the sorts of information you need.<br />
11:49:27 - Mark Dahlquist : The library homepage can be a great place to start, searching for books and journal articles, for example.<br />
11:50:20 - Mark Dahlquist : The libraries also have access to many reference sources, and other sources such as historical data and newspaper articles.<br />

15:03:36 - Roger Justus : Let me look one second
15:04:35 - Patron : I have noticed before that if I search for a journal with a common name like that, that the other journals with that word in their name often come up first. This seems odd to me. Is there a way to prioritize so that the single word title is first?
15:07:10 - Roger Justus : Well with the current library system, our options are limited on that but you could try it in quotes and see if that helps.  Looks like that journal is no longer published!  
15:07:10 - Roger Justus : As of January 2023, <em>Evolution</em> is no longer published by Wiley. More information can be found on the new publisher’s website: <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/evolut""><a href=""https://academic.oup.com/evolut"" target=""_blank"">https://academic.oup.com/evolut</a></a>

15:08:43 - Patron : Or did all the content go to OA? That would make sense.

15:11:45 - Roger Justus : Yea looks like it is a very small number that is open
15:11:46 - Patron : This is a hugely important journal.

15:50:03 - Katie Gibson : I might direct you to a different person
15:50:05 - Katie Gibson : ah, ok
15:50:29 - Katie Gibson : Our history librarian Jenny Presnell might be a better person to talk to
15:50:42 - Katie Gibson : presnejl@miamioh.edu is her email
15:51:24 - Patron : Maybe. Or maybe you know that you're drowning in copies from other alumni and I should just send this on to Thrift Books? That's where our local public library sends donations.
15:51:27 - Katie Gibson : Or, Jacky Johnson in our archives.
15:51:50 - Katie Gibson : Let me check how many copies we have in our collection
15:52:17 - Katie Gibson : Yeah, we do have many copies
15:52:24 - Katie Gibson : Thrift books may be a better option for you
15:52:43 - Patron : I looked. There are a handful. (retired reference librarian here). OK, that's the route I'll go. Thank you for your time.
15:52:54 - Katie Gibson : Ah, I see

10:16:30 - Patron : OK, well, I guess I should wait awhile and see if in say another week or two I can access it. In the meantime, I might try while logged into MyMiami to search for other e-materials and see if I have better luck accessing them.

For a better number, you could check to see if there has been a literature or systemic review on this subject that has attempted to quantify the number of research articles in this area over time.<br />

17:00:31 - Patron : Hello!
17:01:23 - Mark Dahlquist : This should limit sources to peer-reviewed, ones, but it is always good to double-check. Also, even sources that are generally peer-reviewed sometimes publish non-peer reviewed content, such as book reviews or letters to the editor, etc.<br />
17:01:48 - Patron : ok thanks. where will it confirm that it has been peer reviewed?
17:03:21 - Mark Dahlquist : The interface itself should already have limited results to those it regards as coming from peer-reviewed sources, however if you have doubts, you can always google the journal to learn more about it, or check a journal index such as Ulrich's to see if it has rated the journal in question.<br />
17:04:13 - Mark Dahlquist : Here is a link to Ulrich's Periodicals Index, which is one source of journal evaluations: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/ulrichs-periodicals-directory"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/ulrichs-periodicals-directory</a><br />
17:04:14 - Patron : ok I am surprised when clicking on the record that it doesn't say something like ""Peer Reviewed: Y or N""
17:06:09 - Mark Dahlquist : Yes, I agree that this could be clearer. However if the peer-reviewed check mark as been applied then all results are from what EBSCO has indicated are peer-reviewed journals (though again with the limitations that there may still be a few non-peer reviewed results from such journals).<br />
17:06:58 - Mark Dahlquist : You might want to check with your professor about a particular journal or article (or I could check on one of these if you'd like).<br />
17:08:56 - Patron : that's ok, I will just let my professor know that I was confused by this. since I have multiple sources I don't know if it would be the best use of time to look them up elsewhere to see if they are official peer reviewed. I understand what you mean by that filter, it would just be cool if there there was a standard way to indicate that the particular piece of work is peer reviewed vs. assuming with the filter (which is probably correct)
17:09:11 - Mark Dahlquist : In general search results in our library interface that appear with the label ""Academic Journal"" can be regarded as peer reviewed.<br />
17:10:23 - Mark Dahlquist : This is likely what your professor is looking for, but it may be good to check if you have questions about particular journals.<br />
17:11:29 - Patron : thank you so much! have a great day and I appreciate it!

13:32:09 - Ginny Boehme : I'm guessing the first result is the one you're after in this case?
13:32:46 - Ginny Boehme : If so, you can either request it be pulled from the shelf for you, or you can come in person to check it out
13:34:01 - Ginny Boehme : If you're looking at any of the electronic books (most of the other results), you can click ""connect to electronic book"" and get taken to a new page where you can read it online. Sometimes you can download a chapter or two to read later, but you won't be able to download the entire book
13:34:13 - Ginny Boehme : Does this help?
13:34:40 - Patron : Ok, I don't live local to Oxford. Can I have books sent to local collages or to the Cleveland zoo?
13:35:55 - Ginny Boehme : Oh, yes! I'm so sorry. There are a couple of ways to do that. I think the easiest is to click ""request item"" under the print book title, and select ""Home Delivery"" as your pickup location
13:36:42 - Patron : Awesome, I didn't realize that was an option. Thanks so much
13:37:03 - Ginny Boehme : It hasn't been an option for very long, and it's not obvious

Do you mean in a search done using the library's ""Articles and More"" search tool, for example?<br />
17:03:49 - Patron : Yes. So my search term gave me 1,252 results. When I go to the last page, it tells me it removes duplicates and I end up with 789 results. But I have to go to page five, then hit the next button to get to page 6-10, then go ot page 10 and hit the next button to get to page 11-15 and so on. I cannot figure out how to either skip directly to the last page to remove the duplicates, or figure out if there is a way to remove duplicates without going to the last page.
17:07:10 - Mark Dahlquist : Yes, there are some ways to do this; if you look at the ""share"" pull-down button in the upper right hand corner of the first page of results, one option will be to ""Export Results"" which should allow you to email a link to a large number of exported results.<br />
17:08:16 - Mark Dahlquist : However duplicate results should in general be removed automatically. You can also sort to put either newest or oldest results first in your list of search results.<br />

17:10:18 - Mark Dahlquist : Sorry you were cut off!<br />
17:10:34 - Patron : It still had the 1252 number of results. I had to sign out and then log back in so I lost my ""duplicates removed"" results that I had before
17:11:29 - Mark Dahlquist : Hmm. I could try running this search if you'd be ok with giving me the search term you're using.<br />
17:12:06 - Patron : I am using conservation AND inspire. I did not select fields for either term
17:12:38 - Mark Dahlquist : Ok, great I'll search for this in ""Articles and More"" and see what comes up. Hold on a moment, please.<br />
17:14:31 - Patron : ok. Thanks
17:16:53 - Mark Dahlquist : Thanks! I'm taking a look for this. I'm seeing 1,626 results for this, initially.<br />
17:17:52 - Patron : Yes, sorry, I forgot to mention that I limited it to peer review journals and limited the dates to 2013-2023
17:18:09 - Mark Dahlquist : Ah, I see! Ok thanks.<br />
17:23:51 - Mark Dahlquist : I don't see duplicates at this point, but I do notice that only 40 items can be added to a folder at once. If you'd like to download all search results, one option would be to email yourself an RIS file to open in Zotero (if you are familiar with this citation management tool).<br />
17:24:53 - Patron : Yes, the duplicates are not removed until you go to the very last page. In this case, it was page 16. But I noticed this because as I was a few pages in there were a few articles that I saw more than once.
17:25:09 - Mark Dahlquist : Hmm that's interesting.<br />
17:25:09 - Patron : Maybe they come from different databases?
17:26:14 - Mark Dahlquist : It should be attempting to de-dupe automatically. Please give me moment to check on this.<br />
17:26:58 - Patron : ok. thanks
17:28:24 - Mark Dahlquist : So, I set the search to display 50 results per screen (the maximum number). When I made it to the last screen of results I see that they only go up to 790 but I see no option to remove duplicates.<br />
17:28:53 - Mark Dahlquist : If you have that message up right now, would it be possible to send me a screenshot of it?<br />
17:28:58 - Patron : yes, it removed them automatically on teh last page. But I was hoping to figure out a way to remove them without going to the last page
17:29:34 - Patron : Ok. Hold on. Let me open a new tab and go through the pages.
17:31:13 - Mark Dahlquist : I see, so you'd like it to display the 790 results and also to correctly state that it has found that number of results, instead of incorrectly stating at first that there are 1252 results, right?<br />
17:31:36 - Patron : attached a file: <a href=""https://libanswers.lib.miamioh.edu/chat_file.php?i=1286&amp;f=468003&amp;preview=true"" target=""_blank"" class=""s-la-cfile"" data-preview=""inline"">https://libanswers.lib.miamioh.edu/chat_file.php?i=1286&amp;f=468003&amp;preview=true</a>
17:32:48 - Patron : Yes. I don't need need all 790 on the same page, but I don't want to have to search through duplicates either. I would like to figure out a way to remove them automatically. or go the the last page more easily
17:34:59 - Mark Dahlquist : I see. Do you happen to have an example or two of an article that appeared more than once in your search results? <br />
17:36:02 - Mark Dahlquist : I'm curious as to whether it is de-duping but still counting dupes as it numbers the results, or if the duplicate items are actually appearing multiple times in the results.<br />
17:36:42 - Mark Dahlquist : (By the way, thanks again for pointing out this issue).<br />
17:38:03 - Patron : I have seen articles appear multiple times in the results. Hold on, I think I remember one that I saw multiple times, but I want to go through and see if I am remembering correctly.
17:38:45 - Mark Dahlquist : That would be great information to share with our technical services team if you can find it.<br />
17:39:07 - Patron : ""Everyone loves a success story..."" by Macafee et al is number 4 and number 52
17:39:30 - Mark Dahlquist : Thanks, hold on one moment, please.<br />
17:41:00 - Patron : Another example is ""Viewing African and Asian elephants..."" by Miller et al. Number 11 and 95.
17:43:15 - Mark Dahlquist : Hmm; that's very interesting. I get Mcafee's article as #4 but not #52 let me take a look at the other one, too. Hold on pleas.e<br />
17:44:12 - Mark Dahlquist : Hmm the same is happening to me with the second example.<br />
17:44:45 - Mark Dahlquist : It looks like my results are de-duped while you're aren't.  <br />
17:44:55 - Mark Dahlquist : Are you accessing the catalog from off-campus?<br />
17:45:31 - Patron : Yes. But when we talked earlier, you went to the end page and saw that it went from 1252 to aroudn 790. Are you still on the search with the duplicates removed from  earlier?
17:45:48 - Patron : I am off campus
17:46:54 - Mark Dahlquist : Yes, it states that there are 1252 results but seems only to show 790 (the duplicates are included in the count but not actually displayed among the search results as far as I can see).<br />
17:47:39 - Patron : Hm. Interesting. I wonder why that is. Do you think that because I am off campus, it does not remove duplicates?
17:49:17 - Mark Dahlquist : I'm not sure whether that might be the issue, but it may be something our technical services people will want to ask about. <br />
17:50:06 - Mark Dahlquist : I think I may have to follow up on this via email, or have someone reach out to you.<br />
17:51:09 - Mark Dahlquist : I'm sorry that this issue is affecting your search results.<br />
17:52:54 - Patron : Not a problem. I'd seen this before and this is the first time I was asking. I wasn't sure if I was missing something obvious. did you need my email address?
17:53:42 - Mark Dahlquist : Yes, can you please give me your email address? <br />
17:53:52 - Mark Dahlquist : Also, one additional question: am I right in understanding that you have to 
page through all 1252 search results before you see the ""duplicates 
removed"" message?
17:55:47 - Patron : Yes. I have to scroll down to the bottom of the page and go through the pages until I get to the final page where I get the message that I sent you that duplicates have been removed.
17:56:09 - Patron : my email is nageotnl@miamioh.edu
17:56:22 - Mark Dahlquist : Great; that's what I thought (I also see this message, but only after going though 790).<br />
17:56:56 - Mark Dahlquist : Thanks! I will follow up on this and get back to you, or someone else might possibly follow up if we have more questions.<br />
17:57:11 - Mark Dahlquist : I really appreciate this feedback and your patience.<br />
17:57:25 - Patron : Not a problem. thank you for your help!
17:57:36 - Mark Dahlquist : You're welcome! Have a great evening.<br />

15:16:13 - Patron : I'm not sure I have an account with that

15:21:45 - Patron : Same thing, it's asking for a password. I'll try clearing my cookies

15:26:09 - Kristen Adams : I don't see a print copy
15:26:15 - Patron : Or, is there a way to sign in?
15:26:26 - Kristen Adams : I can reprot this to IT so they can fix the off campus issue

15:27:12 - Patron : Actually, what would be most helpful is the index, if there is one. I need to see how often and whether this author uses a certain academic term. And maybe the intro.

15:28:19 - Kristen Adams : and a table of contents
15:28:36 - Patron : Sorry to ask an annoying question, but could you run a quick search of the book to see if the author mentions ""multilingual"" or ""multilingualism""? That's really what I need to know. It's not in the index...
15:28:48 - Kristen Adams : sure, let me try that
15:28:53 - Patron : Thank you so much
15:29:26 - Kristen Adams : there are 6 results for ""

15:31:01 - Kristen Adams : do you need the chapter titles?

However, if you go to Databases A-Z on the library home page and use the dropdown menus to specify ""video"" there are 18 choices there and some look promising such as the Alexander Street Press one and Kanopy.

15:52:33 - Zachary Grisham : Environment Complete includes 1,496 active indexed and abstracted journals. 1,361 of them are peer-reviewed. 
15:52:37 - Zachary Grisham : I missed it too.
15:52:40 - Patron : If you could that would be great.
15:53:08 - Patron : do you know what it is for BSC?
15:54:12 - Zachary Grisham : It says at the bottom of the other website as well, ""Business Source Complete includes 4,276 active indexed and abstracted journals. 3,039 of them are peer-reviewed. ""
15:54:36 - Patron : Holy Moly. That is a lot....
15:55:16 - Zachary Grisham : It does seem like quite a bit. I bet they would be willing to provide a list of them if you would like to check the accuracy of that statement.
15:55:30 - Zachary Grisham : It usually comes in excel format and likely would have a peer-reviewed section.
15:55:41 - Patron : I still can't see where it says that for either of these.  Haha, I am not adding these up to check them. :)
15:55:59 - Zachary Grisham : Fair enough! Would you care to screenshare? I would be happy to show you.
15:56:04 - Patron : excel format-- the spreadsheet could do it... :)
15:57:01 - Patron : okay-- I see it on the ESC...
15:57:21 - Zachary Grisham : It is at the bottom of BSC as well.
15:57:33 - Zachary Grisham : In the section
15:57:42 - Zachary Grisham : ""the highest quality subject indexing""
15:57:45 - Zachary Grisham : last paragraph
15:58:14 - Patron : okay-- got it, That is insane. Guess I will believe them. Thanks for your help!
15:58:40 - Zachary Grisham : You are welcome! Feel free to email me if you want the lists, would be happy to request them from Ebsco for you.
15:58:56 - Patron : Thanks! have a good afternoon

I want to read this book out of personal interest, and thought I'd be able to download it to read on my comoputer at home (which is where I am now), as that's where I have the time to do such reading. I've gone in and looked at the book online, but it wants me to sign into ebsco to download it (I don't have an account there), and I tried to download a PDF version and it would not let me. The problem with reading it online is that I get about 3040 minutes and a number of pages into it, and the text just disappears, especially if I have it open in a tab in my browser and go look at a different window or tab, when I return the text isn't there. So trying to jsut read it online isn't turning out to be very helpful, but I don't know how to download or which format I should download.","","76","","16:37:52 - Zachary Grisham : Hey Nancy, I can help you with  this.
16:38:42 - Zachary Grisham : If I remember Ebsco does make you create an account. This is because when you download it, they count this as you ""checking it out""
16:38:57 - Zachary Grisham : Let me take a glance though to make sure I am right. 
16:39:01 - Zachary Grisham : What book were you looking for?
16:40:38 - Patron : It is called Gentelligence, by Megan Gerhardt (a Miami prof), and librarian Kristen Adams had looked it up and said it was part of the Hamilton MU library.
16:41:08 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, no worries, I am sure we can figure this out to make life easier for you.
16:41:19 - Patron : Here's the link she sent me: <a href=""https://eds-s-ebscohost-com.proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=4dd96322-b823-4904-9ef6-9008c9de6628%40redis&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCxjcGlkJmN1c3RpZD1zOTAwMjk2MyZzaXRlPWVkcy1saXZlJnNjb3BlPXNpdGU%3d#AN=2929725&amp;db=nlebk"" target=""_blank"">https://eds-s-ebscohost-com.proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=4dd96322-b823-4904-9ef6-9008c9de6628%40redis&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCxjcGlkJmN1c3RpZD1zOTAwMjk2MyZzaXRlPWVkcy1saXZlJnNjb3BlPXNpdGU%3d#AN=2929725&amp;db=nlebk</a>
16:42:04 - Zachary Grisham : Is it this book?

16:43:31 - Patron : Yes, that's it. Kristen Adams was telling me wit hthat link, I shouldn't need to create an Ebsco account (I feel like MU makes us create too many accounts in too many different places, but if I have to in order to read it easily, I guess I'll have to!)
16:44:48 - Zachary Grisham : I should be able to figure this out, your link is not working for me though and unfortunately it is telling me online access is not there. 
16:44:54 - Zachary Grisham : Give me a moment to figure out why this is so.
16:45:07 - Patron : Sure -- I appreciate it!
16:47:02 - Zachary Grisham : Can you send me the direct link to the book?
16:47:13 - Zachary Grisham : Not the url but the permalink actually in ebsco?
16:47:18 - Zachary Grisham : The one when you are reading it.
16:51:48 - Patron : That's the one I just sent you, I think (see my comment of 4:41:18 PM)
16:52:43 - Zachary Grisham : I saw that but that one is sending me into a loop. Ebsco links can do that. 
16:53:04 - Zachary Grisham : Do you have it pulled up where it is available to read?
16:53:10 - Patron : Kristen told me it has to be accessed through the MU Hamilton website, if that's any help.
16:53:10 - Zachary Grisham : If so, I was looking for that link.
16:53:15 - Zachary Grisham : Oh!
16:53:20 - Zachary Grisham : Yep, that makes sense.
16:53:51 - Zachary Grisham : I will use that avenue now.
16:53:53 - Zachary Grisham : :)
16:54:27 - Patron : I don't understand why that is, for a book that one would think would be within Oxford's collections, but I don't know how this stuff works.
16:54:28 - Zachary Grisham : I was just able to download the PDF.
16:54:37 - Zachary Grisham : Are you able to do that?
16:55:47 - Zachary Grisham : If not, I can walk you through that. 
16:55:54 - Zachary Grisham : Then you can download it all to your computer.
16:56:24 - Patron : The whole thing? Let me try it again. I'm on the main page that you just sent me (that I was looking at before), and goingto the menu on the left sidebar, and clicking on ""PDF Full Text"". I'll tell you what happens in a minute.
16:56:33 - Zachary Grisham : Thanks!
16:56:39 - Zachary Grisham : Yep, that is what I was referring to.

16:58:41 - Patron : Here's a screenshot of the message I'm getting when trying to get the PDF full text:
16:58:51 - Zachary Grisham : I will sign out of it. 
16:59:03 - Zachary Grisham : It seems that this ebook only allows one user at a time.
16:59:06 - Zachary Grisham : One moment
16:59:30 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, I signed out. Please feel free to try again.
16:59:43 - Patron : OK, trying now.
16:59:49 - Zachary Grisham : Thanks!
17:00:06 - Patron : Just got the same message (about 3 seconds ago).
17:01:02 - Zachary Grisham : Alright, I might shut off my computer to make sure everything signs out then come back on chat. However, unfortunately to download this book fully you have to create an Ebsco account. The reason is because we only have one copy of this book available for checkout.
17:01:18 - Zachary Grisham : That account is Ebsco's way of making sure tons of people are not using it at the same time. 
17:01:40 - Zachary Grisham : You can though download the pdf which allows you to read it online 
17:01:46 - Zachary Grisham : I think this is what you were having trouble with.
17:04:05 - Patron : After trying the online PDF today and having problems with it that i described before, I was hoping to do an actual download of the book. Do you know, with a downloaded book, how long the ""checkout"" period is for staff like me? If I can get a copy of the book that *actually functions well*, the reading should only take me 3 or 4 weeks most likely.
17:05:08 - Zachary Grisham : Good question, I do not know the answer to that off the top of my head. Let me ask circulation really quick. 
17:06:18 - Patron : Thanks. I had originally wanted to just read it online (no worries about ""borrowing"", etc.) until I ran into the stability issues with that earlier today. :(
17:07:47 - Zachary Grisham : Sorry to hear there were stability issues. Did it keep signing you out of the Miami databases?
17:07:57 - Zachary Grisham : I know you mentioned text kept disappearing
17:09:40 - Patron : No, it didn't sign me out, but yes, the text kept disappearing when I would toggle between tabs. It might be a browser interface issue. Also, I found the scrolling between pages difficult.
17:10:38 - Zachary Grisham : Did you have trouble with both the download pdf (where it goes chapter by chapter, not full download) as well as the ebook online reading?
17:11:59 - Patron : I didn't try to chapter by chapter download(s), thinking that one would have to download each chapter individually (is that how that works?)
17:12:21 - Zachary Grisham : So, that only allows 60 pages per download without signing in.
17:12:24 - Zachary Grisham : :(
17:12:36 - Zachary Grisham : Again it is ebsco making sure we only have one ebook
17:12:48 - Zachary Grisham : However, are you a member of oxford lane libraries?
17:12:59 - Zachary Grisham : if so, they actually have an ebook available for download.
17:13:46 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://lnpl.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/default/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fERC_405_245$002f0$002fERC_405_245:OVERDRIVE:7d418103-9e7a-4c3f-a4d1-5d29ba463a78/one?qu=ISBN%3D%229781538142158%22"" target=""_blank"">https://lnpl.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/default/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fERC_405_245$002f0$002fERC_405_245:OVERDRIVE:7d418103-9e7a-4c3f-a4d1-5d29ba463a78/one?qu=ISBN%3D%229781538142158%22</a>
17:14:01 - Patron : yes! Do they have it there (and then I wonder how many copies they have?)
17:14:16 - Zachary Grisham : Yep, I am betting they have more than us. Either way, it is available.
17:14:23 - Zachary Grisham : Just sent you the link!<br />
17:15:03 - Zachary Grisham : To answer your question, yep, they seem to have Gentilligence available on ebook.
17:15:40 - Zachary Grisham : Were you able to access it via the link?
17:15:54 - Patron : I just was guessing that with this book, since there is a Miami connection, that MU would have more/better/faster/easier and all around preferable copies (in Oxford darn it, not Hamilton, since that is where the author is based and FSB is located, etc.)
17:16:45 - Zachary Grisham : Many times if we have it in Hamilton we tend to not purchase it for Oxford because it can be sent over so easily.
17:16:58 - Patron : I'll try going to Lane's website and using my credentials to log in there. My experience with their site has been a little better than ebsco/Miami.
17:17:01 - Zachary Grisham : And vice versa.
17:17:07 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, did you use the link I just sent?
17:17:14 - Zachary Grisham : It was that book ready to be downloaded.
17:17:18 - Zachary Grisham : If not, I can send it again.
17:17:24 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://lnpl.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/default/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fERC_405_245$002f0$002fERC_405_245:OVERDRIVE:7d418103-9e7a-4c3f-a4d1-5d29ba463a78/one?qu=ISBN%3D%229781538142158%22"" target=""_blank"">https://lnpl.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/default/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fERC_405_245$002f0$002fERC_405_245:OVERDRIVE:7d418103-9e7a-4c3f-a4d1-5d29ba463a78/one?qu=ISBN%3D%229781538142158%22</a>
17:17:58 - Zachary Grisham : I believe all you need to do is push download then type in your credentials.
17:19:36 - Patron : Just logged into lane and downloaded the browser version -- I'll see how that goes. I'm gonna try Miami for other things later -- I hope this is just a one-time thing and other ebooks from MU will be easier -- thanks for your help! If i have issues with the lane version, I'll contact their help desk.
17:20:00 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, let us know if we can be of any further help! Glad you got the book somehow.

10:17:17 - Jenny Presnell : we did the it thing for awhile, but It didn't want to provide/pay and we didn't either
10:17:26 - Jenny Presnell : yeah that is true
10:18:04 - Patron : We moved the main IT help desk into the library last year instead of the basement of a parking deck where they were before, so for the time being they're grateful for the new and much better location.  We'll keep milking them for all we can while the gratitude is there, lol
10:18:08 - Jenny Presnell : but I'd rather do the water fountain thing than send someone away because I couldn't find the series of standards for something (which I now forget)
10:18:30 - Patron : Standards, oh man.  Yeah, that's a trigger word to immediately get a librarian
10:19:13 - Patron : Well I better get back about my research on this reference tracker.  If by chance you happen to remember its name, could you email me at john.kromer@njit.edu?

12:58:28 - Laura Birkenhauer : Another option, if you have a citation, is to search with the article title in our Google Scholar tab. If you're logged in, you'll see a ""Find It at MiamiOH"" link to the right of the results that connect you with relevant databases. To be honest, that's one of my favorite ways to search if I have a citation.
12:58:56 - Patron : Thank you.
13:00:14 - Laura Birkenhauer : You're welcome!
13:00:36 - Patron : For some reason, the Find it at Miami link didn't turn up when I tried it 10 min ago. As for the E-journal option, that is so time consuming. I find that search to be really bad. For example, try searching it for the journal Sound Studies.
13:02:24 - Laura Birkenhauer : Yes, the results for that are not good at all!
13:02:38 - Laura Birkenhauer : I think it's because we don't actually have access to that journal
13:02:39 - Patron : My experience is that I find a good article online and then try to find my options for getting access. I go to the library website and end up wasting a surprising amount of time.
13:03:09 - Laura Birkenhauer : You're not wrong, it's quite confusing!
13:03:36 - Patron : Unfortunately, that journal is in my area of specialization. And I face this problem constantly. I get that we don't subscribe to it, but why is it so hard to see if OhioLink has it?
13:04:04 - Patron : There are lots of small journals like this in my field, so I waste a lot of time.
13:04:09 - Laura Birkenhauer : I can check our access in OhioLINK.

The second is from Baltic Journal of Management v. 17 issue 1 2021/2022. Also same situation for Interlibrary Loan. I do hope this helps you but if you are not affiliated with our university there's not much I can provide full-text wise.
14:13:13 - Patron : i am a faculty member..
14:13:25 - Patron : does that count for affiliation?
14:15:03 - Barry Zaslow : Are you faculty here at Miami? Then you should be able to use Interlibrary Loan with the link I provided. You may need to create a free account, then put in new request, article, and fill in the boxes for each article's title, authors, journal from which it comes, etc. citation. The staff will try to find it and have it scanned to your e-mail. Sometimes it's fairly quick, other times if it's more obscure it will take some days.
14:15:24 - Patron : yes I am.. !
14:16:17 - Barry Zaslow : If you get confused or have trouble with the Interlibrary Loan process reach out to Sheila Sparks at sparkssk@miamioh.edu. She is the expert for this area.

13:14:27 - Mark Dahlquist : Or is there an example database you are thinking of?<br />
13:15:19 - Patron : For instance the US News and world report grad school compass database ? I can't believe I am the only student to ever request this type of reference data ?
13:16:25 - Mark Dahlquist : We don't have paid access to the US News Rankings. However, much of that information is publicly available at their site, I believe.<br />
13:17:05 - Mark Dahlquist : Hold on a moment and I will check to see if there are other ways of accessing this here at Miami.<br />
13:17:42 - Patron : No, it is not. Just basic profile not the most relevant info. It is paid access gated.
13:20:20 - Mark Dahlquist : Yes, it looks like they offer a paid version of their service for $29.99 per month. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like we have an institutional subscription to the US News College Compass service.<br />
13:23:19 - Mark Dahlquist : I'm doing some checking to see if I can find this elsewhere for you.<br />
13:24:09 - Patron : Can you please send a note to your Boss asking him/her to send a note to all department heads at MU to see if such access would be helpful in there new student recruitment process. Graduate school acceptance rates for a University's graduates has traditionally been an extremely important metric for graduate outcomes. see the following Vassar page among others that offers this access <a href=""https://offices.vassar.edu/career-education/graduate-and-law/graduate-school/researching-programs/"" target=""_blank"">https://offices.vassar.edu/career-education/graduate-and-law/graduate-school/researching-programs/</a>

One initial question I have is whether you've also tried using other search tools like the ""Articles and More"" search or Google Scholar? These might broaden the search a bit to include more articles on social engagement issues.<br />

15:02:16 - Mark Dahlquist : Web of Science is great but does tend to focus on the ""hard"" sciences and and miss some social sciences/education type materials. If you try an ""Articles and More"" search from the library homepage, there is a ""limit to peer-reviewed articles"" box you can check to ensure you're getting articles from peer-reviewed journals only.<br />

There might be some accessibility angle whereby a student who makes an accessibility/accommodation request can have something printed or scanned, but I am not familiar with a program with wide applicability. 
12:14:26 - Patron : ok, thanks
12:14:31 - Nate Floyd : But I imagine that is something that is handled through that office. :) 
12:14:56 - Patron : This was something separate from that accommodation. I will see if I can get her to give me more specifics. Thanks again.

17:02:56 - Patron : Thanks.  I have a few more questions.  I found the Unseen Enemy DVD!  May I return it and not be charged $100.  It was my fault that I did not find it at the end of last semester.  And --- I have not found the book Plant-Derived Antimycotics: current trends and future prospects.  How much will I owe for this book?  I appreciate your help.
17:04:58 - Rob O'Brien Withers : Hi Marcia, We do reduce charges when materials are returned. For lost items, we will normally attempt to negotiate a replacement copy of the item (if it's available / current / reasonably priced); or else substitute a more up-to-date item on a similar topic. If you email libfines@miamioh.edu, one of our service associates can walk through the process with you.
17:06:37 - Patron : Thanks.  I will bring the Unseen Enemy to King Library in a few minutes.  And I will email the libfines@miamioh.edu as you advise. Again, thank you!

16:34:14 - Patron : Thanks Mark. I cannot find guidance on how to format ellipsis where I am editing out a section of quotation I wish to cite. Google searches seem to imply APA 7th wishes me to insert a space before and after each dot of the ellipsis but that creates a very strange looking element in the quotation. I just can't find reference to this particular issue in the APA Citation Style Guide (which has otherwise been invaluable and comprehensive).

16:35:29 - Patron : Thank you - I'm very grateful but understand if you're not able to find an answer.
16:38:33 - Mark Dahlquist : It does seem to be correct that there are spaces between dots in ellipses in APA7.

16:39:32 - Mark Dahlquist : So that could also permit a more compact version of an ellipsis.<br />
16:40:33 - Patron : Gosh - thanks so much indeed for that. It feels like such a minor question but it's been niggling at me. 16k word dissertation can now be submitted with confidence that I know the formatting is correct. Thank you from the UK!

 User: Stefanie Hilles

","23","","17:31:53 - Patron : Hi. I put the request in with Jenny P. in the summer, so I am just following up. I need the volume for a course.
17:32:05 - Stefanie Hilles : Oh! Let me transfer you over to her.
17:32:50 - Jenny Presnell : Hi Matthew
17:32:58 - Jenny Presnell : I'll check it is really expensive
17:33:06 - Jenny Presnell : let me see what happened
17:33:50 - Patron : Jenny - hi. I start the course on Wednesday and wanted to know if we have the volume. It does look like we have the hard copy (which I requested) but it would be really nice to have the electronic version.
17:34:05 - Jenny Presnell : I think they are different
17:34:23 - Jenny Presnell : the hard copy may not have all the essays -- I think the ebook is updated?
17:35:15 - Patron : Hmm, that I don't know but the TOC looks the same although I only skimmed it. In any case, you had thought at one point that we could get volume 2.
17:38:52 - Jenny Presnell : I asked if it would be part of the cambridge core and acquisitions finally said no. For vol 2 __ I think that is what we said, it is $520.00. 
17:38:53 - Jenny Presnell : I
17:39:54 - Jenny Presnell : I'll see what I can do.  
17:40:41 - Jenny Presnell : are you looking for your essay?
17:40:59 - Jenny Presnell : The print is listed as 2011 and the ebook 2021
17:41:10 - Jenny Presnell : so I need to check
17:41:37 - Jenny Presnell : You could also copy the article and link it in Canvas
17:41:51 - Jenny Presnell : I'll work on it 
17:43:12 - Patron : Thanks. Ouch, it is expensive. No, it is not just about my chapter. I am using (or hope to use) many of the chapters for a capstone course this term. My idea is to have the students use the chapters as a starting point for research essays.
17:43:25 - Jenny Presnell : ok
17:44:38 - Jenny Presnell : We do collections a bit differently these days, so I will need to ask the humanities collection group if they support that cost. I'll send it out shortly. 
17:44:46 - Jenny Presnell : let you know tomorrow. 
17:45:02 - Jenny Presnell : Can you confirm though that it is volume 2

18:14:20 - Barry Zaslow : It looks as if there are copies in print at all the libraries, although they are in reference so would need to stay in the buildings (you are allowed to scan portions yourself at the printer/copiers, though). The call # is BF 76.7 .P83 2020. I don't see a latest ed. in e-format in our collection. The likelihood of being able to download it is remote given copyright restrictions but I'm not an expert in that area. There is an e-version of the APA style guide to electronic references which says you may print copies for personal use only but that isn't the whole manual. Does this help?

18:30:04 - Barry Zaslow : That's OK. We don't have any online versions of the 7th ed. APA manual, only in print at all the libraries in Reference BF 76.7 .P83 2020

. You are welcome to scan portions at any of the public copier/printers.

That is taken from the 6th ed and is not the whole manual, though.

You can check it out for 2 hours at a time. If I were you, I'd call and check the front desk to make sure it is available before you arrive.

10:29:43 - Nate Floyd : You are limited to 2 hours, but as long as no one else is waiting on it you can keep renewing 2 hours at a time. Not ideal but it might work in a pinch. 
10:31:14 - Patron : Okay, sounds good. Do you know for this particular book if there is a way I could purchase it instead just to not have to keep coming back and renewing and checking it out?
10:32:00 - Nate Floyd : Sure, I'm sure you can search for the title of the book on Amazon or at the MU Bookstore. Professor just put books on reserve to try to help students save money. But you are free to buy your own copy for sure.
10:33:22 - Patron : Thank you for the clarification on that. I will probably be up in the library in an hour or so to check out the book and possibly purchase in the next day or so. Thanks for all your help!

10:54:30 - Patron : I am curious to see if King Library has a book that I need for a class and if I can reserve that book but I'm not sure if/how I can do that
10:55:02 - Barry Zaslow : OK. Please give me the title and author and if you need a specific edition (2020 for example or 6th edition)
10:55:20 - Patron : Rhethawks 2023-2024
10:55:34 - Barry Zaslow : Please hold on while I check on this for you.
10:57:28 - Barry Zaslow : It looks like there are two copies on reserve at King Library so if you go to the main desk just inside the doors they should be able to give you one. Usually these circulate for two hours at a time but check with the staff there to be sure. Does this help?
10:57:57 - Patron : What do you mean when you say ""Usually these circulate for two hours at a time""
10:59:14 - Barry Zaslow : Each title on reserve has a specific loan period depending on what the professor decides. Some things check out for three days, some for one day, but the vast majority of books have to be used for two hours only. If no one else needs it after your two hours you can renew it. 
11:00:05 - Barry Zaslow : I can't tell from the information on my screen what the policy is for Rhethawks so best to confirm that with the people at the desk.
11:00:48 - Barry Zaslow : King is open 7am-1am every day in case that is of concern.
11:01:30 - Barry Zaslow : Be aware though that given this weekend upcoming is Labor Day holiday there may be shortened hours so check the webpage at <a href=""http://www.lib.miamioh.edu"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lib.miamioh.edu</a>
11:07:29 - Barry Zaslow : I just checked and King is open 7am-5pm Friday, closed Saturday and Sunday, open again at 1pm Monday through 1am Tues. This is just for the holiday, though, Normal hours will resume after Sept. 4.

12:02:28 - Zachary Grisham : As I thought most of our databases dont go back that far. 
12:02:46 - Zachary Grisham : However, if you look at the Gale Lit Resource Center it says it stops at 1978
12:02:56 - Zachary Grisham : We can look in there and try to find it. 
12:02:59 - Zachary Grisham : Do you know the title?
12:03:08 - Patron : I looked at Gale before chatting but could not find 1987. Am I doing something wrong?

12:03:59 - Patron : :-)
12:04:00 - Zachary Grisham : It looks like it might be omitting 1982-1989
12:04:05 - Patron : Yikes
12:04:15 - Patron : Is there any way around it?
12:04:17 - Zachary Grisham : Let me take a glance into it and see what we can find. Do you happen to know the title?
12:04:28 - Zachary Grisham : I can try other resources if I know the title.
12:04:40 - Patron : I have an SDS student for whom I need a digital copy
12:05:00 - Patron : Otherwise I have the book with me but can't convert it easily
12:05:25 - Zachary Grisham : We have a scanner in the library if it is only a small portion. 
12:05:34 - Zachary Grisham : Not sure how big the book is or copyright on that though.
12:05:50 - Patron : The title is Good Advice is Rarer than Rubies
12:06:03 - Zachary Grisham : Ohh, I thought that was a saying. 
12:06:10 - Zachary Grisham : Did not understand it was a title.
12:06:12 - Patron : it's both :-)
12:08:47 - Zachary Grisham : Well, have not found it on any of the databases I have tried thus far but I have a couple more ideas. 
12:08:57 - Zachary Grisham : Have you tried Hathitrust or Axis360?
12:08:58 - Patron : ok
12:09:04 - Zachary Grisham : If not, I can take a glance at those.
12:09:05 - Patron : No what is is that?
12:09:40 - Zachary Grisham : Hathi is a digital repository of books we subscribe to (or will be soon) and Axis360 is a popular reading service the library subscribes to.
12:09:44 - Zachary Grisham : Will check Hathi first.
12:10:43 - Patron : Thanks. Can you also tell me how to get there from the library website, please?
12:11:14 - Zachary Grisham : Yep! Need to ask a colleague about Hathitrust though, I know the library is planning on subscribing but it might not be available yet. 
12:11:27 - Zachary Grisham : Will send you a clickstream 
12:12:19 - Patron : okay
12:14:02 - Zachary Grisham : Alright the easiest way to get to both of them should be through the ""Databases A-Z"" list link directly beneath the library search tool.
12:14:04 - Zachary Grisham : So, 
12:14:49 - Zachary Grisham : Miami University Library, click ""Databases A-Z"", click ""A"", scroll down to bottom click ""Axis360""
12:15:12 - Zachary Grisham : Be right back about Hathitrust, have not been able to find it in our databases. A bit confused.
12:15:19 - Patron : ok
12:19:15 - Zachary Grisham : Turns out we are not a partner institution yet. However, this is Hathitrust and we should be a member soon.

12:19:32 - Patron : Ok great
12:19:47 - Patron : i will check out Axis360
12:20:18 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, sorry I have not been of more help. It looks like we do not have access to an electronic copy from our library.
12:20:33 - Patron : thanks for trying

12:21:17 - Patron : saw that
12:21:21 - Zachary Grisham : Then you have to sign in.
12:21:33 - Patron : but it requires a subscription i think

12:21:46 - Zachary Grisham : Yep! Well I will look a few more places but I do not have much hope. 
12:21:55 - Patron : that's okay

20:17:15 - Ginny Boehme : Those are not limited to Ohio, they are more general than that
20:17:28 - Ginny Boehme : Let me see what kinds of news I can find for that locality
20:17:49 - Patron : well the assignemnt has to be about a community I am apart of. I don't really understand what ""too broad of a topic "" is
20:18:01 - Patron : thank you
20:18:27 - Ginny Boehme : can you clarify what you've been told about ""too broad of a topic""?
20:18:53 - Patron : I'll have to go back and read it real quick. Is that ok?
20:19:02 - Ginny Boehme : sure, I can wait
20:22:19 - Patron : Make a list of the local communities you belong to. Do your best to list specific local communities: not just ""parent"", or ""sports fan"", or ""concerned citizen"", but ""Lakota Schools parent"", or ""Bengals fan"", or ""food pantry volunteer"". We mean local in an expansive sense: What communities do you belong to in your hometown? In your school? In the Hamilton/Middletown community? In online communities that are important to you? The professional community that you wish to enter?
20:22:45 - Patron : Next, choose two of the ""hot topics"" you listed in the previous step. Tell a brief story about how each one impacts you (or someone close to you) in your everyday life. Each story must be at least 150 words long. Be specific in your writing. Don’t write about a broad, abstract issue. Write about a specific event and how that event impacts or shapes you (or someone you know) as a member of this community
20:24:09 - Patron : This was from the previous assignment but they're connected to eachother. I'm now on to writing two topic proposals for a ""resarch based argument"" based off the previous paper
20:24:55 - Ginny Boehme : Ok, that's good to know. And the bit about ""too broad""? Are they just asking you to pick a defined topic?
20:25:29 - Patron : I am not sure. This is my first class in 13 years
20:25:50 - Patron : I emailed my teacher but she hasn't responded back yet
20:26:01 - Patron : it's due tomorrow
20:29:35 - Ginny Boehme : Ouch, I'm sorry. I think that's probably what they mean, so for example, if you had asked about transgender care in the US, that would be extremely broad. Transgender care of minors is much more narrow. My recommendation, if you intend to focus on those two counties, is to take a look at newspaper websites (like the Dayton Daily News) and read through some of the news reporting they've done on the topic. There are several articles that pop up when I search ""transgender hormone minor"" in the DDN website: <a href=""https://www.daytondailynews.com/search/?q="" target=""_blank"">https://www.daytondailynews.com/search/?q=</a>
20:30:41 - Ginny Boehme : A lot of it is reporting on other events outside Ohio, but there are a few articles about things in this state. You could also play with the search terms and see if different combinations find different articles. Does this make sense? Does it help?
20:31:01 - Patron : Don't you have to pay to see the news paper articles?
20:31:22 - Ginny Boehme : Not always. Is it asking you to pay?
20:31:40 - Patron : yes

20:32:46 - Ginny Boehme : does that get rid of the paywall?
20:33:13 - Patron : says i cant use this resource off campus
20:33:22 - Ginny Boehme : ugh that's so annoying
20:33:39 - Ginny Boehme : some resources allow, and some don't, and it's never clear which ones are which
20:34:07 - Patron : what are the library hours?
20:34:28 - Ginny Boehme : King is open until 1am tonight
20:34:42 - Patron : king?
20:34:46 - Ginny Boehme : King library

20:35:03 - Patron : is that at the middletown campus?
20:35:23 - Ginny Boehme : No, that's Oxford. I'm sorry, I assumed. Let me check Middletown library
20:35:55 - Ginny Boehme : Looks like Middletown Library is closed today

20:39:07 - Ginny Boehme : I'm glad you think so, because I don't feel like I was! I wish the newspaper sites allowed for off-campus access. You could try searching in NexisUni, one of our databases, to see if you can find any news articles in there. Let me give you the links and see if I can find a tutorial (it's notoriously difficult to use)
20:39:30 - Ginny Boehme : NexisUni link: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/nexis-uni"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/nexis-uni</a>

20:52:42 - Ginny Boehme : I have to log off soon, is there anything else I can help with tonight?
20:58:13 - Ginny Boehme : Logging off now, I hope you have a great rest of your night and good luck with your paper!

12:01:34 - Patron : Hi Rob,
12:02:15 - Patron : Yes, my issue is related, but I've tried to correct the problem for many years and I'd like to deal with someone that can help.
12:02:45 - Rob O'Brien Withers : What's the issue?
12:04:34 - Patron : The books listed in my name that remain unreturned to the library were in a car of mine that was stolen in 2004, and duly reported to the Science Library at the time as stolen. so.... it's a long-term issue.
12:05:53 - Rob O'Brien Withers : Hang on, let me pull up your record.
12:08:17 - Rob O'Brien Withers : If this had just happened, we would ask for the police report, but at this stage, that's not an issue. Given the age of the books, we don't need to replace them. If I'm reading this correctly, we haven't sent the bill over to the Bursar yet, which will make it easier to deal with.
12:08:31 - Rob O'Brien Withers : Hang on while I check with someone next door
12:10:57 - Rob O'Brien Withers : They haven't gone to the Bursar, so we will mark them Lost / Paid and remove them from your account. 
12:11:59 - Patron : Good to hear.  I didn't realize that the books were still on my list of borrowed items until i fully retired in 2012.  I had just checked renew all in the intervening period
12:12:45 - Patron : When I emptied my office of lib books in 2012 I noticed the stolen items were still on my list and asked that they be removed at that time as well.
12:13:31 - Patron : Hopefully your attempt to fix the problem will be successful.
12:13:44 - Rob O'Brien Withers : Not sure what happened at the Science Library, but apparently it didn't get resolved or communicated.
12:14:38 - Patron : Yes, that's my assumption as well.  It was at the BEST library that I reiterated the history of the books and there was no action taken there as well
12:15:02 - Patron : SO, I've just been checking ""renew all"" ever since....
12:15:38 - Rob O'Brien Withers : It should be resolved soon - it's still on your account, just contact libfines@miamioh.edu to ask about the timetable for removing - those emails go into a tracking system, so we can (hopefully) prevent things from slipping between the cracks.
12:16:20 - Patron : Ok, I'll check again in a month or so.  Thanks for your assistance.  I have my fingers crossed.

18:47:28 - Patron : or do you happen to just know where and what floor it would be on?
18:48:19 - Nate Floyd : Her office is on the second floor at King Library. You will need to set up an appointment with her because she's not always in her office. Sometimes she is teaching elsewhere on campus or in a meeting. So, before you come to King, you should set up an appointment with her first.

We have a suggestion from our class, and your webpage ended up being one that was featured by our students, so we wanted to notify you and say thank you!

As a part of the assignment one of our students, Kiel, did some research for extra credit and found this resource - www.earlychildhoodeducationdegree.org/early-childhood-special-education/

We thought of sharing this resource with you as it could be immensely helpful for many of your visitors. She would love for it to be added to your already great list of resources. Please let me know if you decide to link to that article so I can share the news with my students.

11:41:12 - Kristen Adams : Have you started searching yet, and if so where?
11:43:09 - Patron : Well the NY Times wants me to pay so I cant use them. I have transportation issues. So getting to campus is hard. The Dayton Daily, google scholar doesn't seem to be very informative it's always like just 1 paragraph of information. But I need two of those. I think (peer-reviewed)
11:43:53 - Kristen Adams : I think I'd look at several sources. Census data would probably be helpful - <a href=""https://data.census.gov/"" target=""_blank"">https://data.census.gov/</a>

11:51:00 - Barry Zaslow : Hi Angela. Have you used any of our databases yet? Depending on whether you need scientific studies or more general articles there are a few places I'd recommend. Academic Search Complete is a good place to start under Databases A-Z. Web of Science is also fairly comprehensive under the same radio button on the home page <a href=""http://www.lib.miamioh.edu"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lib.miamioh.edu</a>
11:51:49 - Patron : I have not looked yet. Do you have any databases that you think would be more focused on animals?
11:53:39 - Barry Zaslow : You can try the section Biology when you go to Databases--that has some more focused ones. Since we don't have a veterinary school we often don't purchase animal-specific resources but some of these look promising. I don't know if Sport Discus would have anything about the benefits for the dog but that's also a useful collection for information about exercise

If you just want access to library books, you can get a card by stopping by the dean's suite on the second floor of King Library and paying $25.
17:06:40 - Patron : Does that give online access to journals?
17:06:44 - Stefanie Hilles : No
17:07:29 - Patron : I'm a former faculty member, and independent researcher.  What are my pathways to online access to journals?
17:07:46 - Stefanie Hilles : Let me check the best way
17:07:50 - Patron : Thx
17:09:42 - Stefanie Hilles : Do you still have an Miami login credentials?
17:09:52 - Patron : Not any longer, no.
17:11:27 - Stefanie Hilles : Ok. I will have to find out what you can do then. The library cannot give login credentials. If you are still in contact with the department chair, they can request an account for you but if that's not an option for you, I will have to investigate further. 
17:12:56 - Patron : That would be appreciated very much.  Can I wait while you check?
17:13:43 - Stefanie Hilles : It would probably be best if you give me an email where I can reach you. It is after 5 so almost everyone I would ask has already left for the day
17:15:01 - Patron : My email is Matthew_Younce@Yahoo.Com.  I taught Math night classes as an Instructor, and attended Math dept. events, colloquia, etc.  Thanks so much for your help!!

17:46:35 - Patron : Oh that looks like a great place to start! Would similar books be close to that one in the library?
17:48:02 - Stefanie Hilles : Yes! Should be right next to each other on the shelf. Although, this is an exhibition catalog, so there is going to be another place in the stacks where the non-exhibition catalogues on surrealism are 
17:49:08 - Patron : Do you think it would be easy to find other books about surrealism while I am at the library?
17:50:12 - Stefanie Hilles : Absolutely! If you want to come tomorrow, I can help between 3-6. If you'd like to come tonight, I am sure Dani, who is excellent, would be able to help :)
17:50:49 - Patron : That's great! I think I will have a look tonight. What time does the Art Library close?
17:51:20 - Stefanie Hilles : We close at 9. I would recommend coming in by 8 at the latest - just to make sure you have enough time
17:51:40 - Patron : Thank you so much. You have been very  helpful. I feel less overwhelmed now

18:25:14 - Barry Zaslow : I get the same situation just going through the libraries site without MyMiami. I checked the Marketing LibGuide and in the description of Marketline there is no information about needing a separate log-in or password. Unfortunately all the tech people have gone home for the day but I can submit this as an issue needing attention when they return in the morning.

18:26:13 - Patron : Ok. It is definitely a new behavior so I think something is wrong the handoff from mymiami to marketline in terms of credientials
18:26:33 - Patron : Is there a way to be updated about the fix (just so I don't need to keep checking periodically?)
18:27:14 - Barry Zaslow : Do you have a current e-mail address? I can include that with my report and they are (usually) good about replying.
18:28:06 - Patron : crainm@miamioh.edu
18:31:07 - Barry Zaslow : OK. I will pass that along. We have a small group of four-five people who work on resolving these issues. Sometimes they have to contact the vendor who may have flipped a switch inadvertently. It does look as if we paid our subscription, though!

17:44:13 - Patron : i'm working on a project that we hope will help educate students on these resources that are available to MU students
17:44:37 - Ginny Boehme : Hmm, ok, I'm not sure how much of it is geared towards students at this point
17:44:46 - Ginny Boehme : Most of what I know of is aimed at faculty
17:45:10 - Patron : yeah, that's the problem that we are trying to solve. I'm Justin. mcglotjm@miamioh.edu

17:46:34 - Ginny Boehme : There are lesson plans in there that are meant to be used to introduce students to generative AI
17:46:46 - Ginny Boehme : Perhaps they will be helpful?
17:47:04 - Patron : Thank you. That is definitely a great start!
17:47:39 - Ginny Boehme : You're welcome! I'm very happy to talk in more detail about this if you like, full disclosure I helped create those information literacy lesson plans

Ebook question.  A patron wanted to use an ebook, but it was limited to 3 users.  3 others were using.  He wanted to know how their use was regulated...was their use timed?  Would they return the ebook when they were finished?  I understand these answers might depend on the ebook...  Any info, always greatly appreciated!","","23","","10:31:48 - Roger Justus : Yea it depends on the ebook.  Let me see if I can find a more ""exact"" answer - do you have the book name?
10:33:46 - Patron : Studying Foreign Policy Comparatively by Laura Neack
10:33:57 - Roger Justus : Ok one minute while I take a look
10:35:06 - Roger Justus : Ok this says one use at a time as well`1
10:35:08 - Roger Justus : !
10:35:21 - Patron : No rush.  We're curious so that we can understand the process more and let the patrons know for their planning.
10:35:46 - Patron : We found where 3 could use it?  and 3 were using it?
10:35:49 - Roger Justus : Funny it is open now!<br /><br />
10:36:03 - Roger Justus : or will be now that I am out of it
10:36:52 - Patron : Do patrons download it once and that's a use?  Or do they have to have it open and that as ause and when they close the document, it's no longer in use?  Broadly speaking?
10:37:43 - Roger Justus : That is what the library page says...  Open and use and get in when they close the document at least, that is what I am seeing.  
10:38:15 - Patron : Is that a policy that is true for all ebooks?
10:38:26 - Patron : or is that a case by case policy?
10:38:42 - Roger Justus : Jenny P is the librarian for this area, and she is not here or I would ask her about this book.  As for all e-books I think it depends (why make it easy) on the provider and agreement we have.  
10:39:46 - Patron : Lol.  Right!
10:39:46 - Roger Justus : I know some are three days some are one and the like with different standards
10:40:57 - Patron : Okay.  So our answer to such questions will be maybe, perhaps, sort of, possibly, could be, and ask again later.  Understood.  Boy.  Like you said, why make it easy?
10:41:04 - Roger Justus : Right I swear
10:41:20 - Patron : Thank you for the feedback.  Appreciated deeply, most sincerely.
10:41:23 - Roger Justus : I will check with the humanites folks as well and see if they have a write up we can give you all!
10:41:41 - Patron : Thanks!  That would be handy and very useful.

13:35:56 - Zachary Grisham : I have a colleague who specializes in maps. Let me reach out to him real quick.
13:36:07 - Zachary Grisham : Also, have you inquired at the public library yet?
13:36:24 - Zachary Grisham : That might be something to keep in our back pocket. They have all kinds of fun historical stuff there on the city.
13:37:00 - Patron : i have not. i'm remote do i can't go there but i'll check the site
13:37:22 - Zachary Grisham : Ahh, no problem. Give me a moment to ask around.
13:38:49 - Patron : i'm not finding anything at the lane libraries
13:39:02 - Zachary Grisham : It would not be online, you would need to ask their history folks. 
13:39:05 - Zachary Grisham : Will send you that link.
13:39:13 - Zachary Grisham : It is also possible our archives have something on the topic.
13:39:19 - Zachary Grisham : Am about to call them really quick.
13:39:40 - Patron : thanks!
13:39:52 - Zachary Grisham : I think this is what it is called.

13:40:12 - Zachary Grisham : It is the room on the second floor of the library. Have had tons of success working with them to support our students in the past. 
13:40:26 - Zachary Grisham : They actually compiled the history of a few buildings for students last semester.
13:41:47 - Patron : they cite maps as one of their holdings but i'm sure i've seen online versdions of the maps
13:41:59 - Zachary Grisham : One moment on the phone with the archives.
13:45:08 - Zachary Grisham : speccoll@miamioh.edu
13:45:42 - Zachary Grisham : I just spoke with the folks upstairs, they said it is likely they have one. Are hoping you could email them directly so they can put it in their system. 
13:46:02 - Zachary Grisham : However, if you have a moment we might be able to find one online. 
13:46:30 - Patron : sure, i can wait or i can email them if you need to move on

13:49:17 - Zachary Grisham : Ok. 
13:49:59 - Patron : it's to ansdwer a question i have with an alumni so it's not really very importsnt
13:51:50 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, don't want to keep you too long then. I would bet that our special collections might have it, but if I were you I would ask the public library first because they have an entire room specifically for the history of this area.
13:51:56 - Zachary Grisham : Would you like their contact info?
13:52:21 - Patron : sure, thanks.

13:56:53 - Zachary Grisham : I do not believe so, that is why I reached out to special collections. It would have been on their website. 
13:57:07 - Zachary Grisham : If you email them, they would be able to tell you more.

19:26:30 - Jenny Presnell : are sections

19:35:19 - Jenny Presnell : This is kind of what I know -- you might want to talk with either the Business/Econ Librarian or the Math Librarian who may have better ways (and words) to look for sources. If you want to do that, I can send you contact information. I'm also happy to hang out if 
19:35:42 - Jenny Presnell : as you look through sources you have questions about finding sources.
19:38:37 - Patron : I think this is enough for right now. I have to read through these and think about how to structure my Master's research next year, but I wanted to get an early start on it. I will stop by the library in the near future to ask for further help. For now, I need to start studying for my exams that are coming up.  Thank you so much for your help!

11:56:56 - Ginny Boehme : topci?
11:57:00 - Ginny Boehme : topic*
11:58:25 - Patron : its for FSW442 - Family Resource Management. we have to create a basic curriculum for saving and investing 101. for my specific topic, I am in charge of finding 5 scholarly sources that talk about basic investment concepts, such as, risk and return, diversification, investment accounts 401k, Roth IRA
11:58:55 - Ginny Boehme : ok please hold, let me see what I can find
12:02:16 - Ginny Boehme : do they have to be scholarly/peer-reviewed? or is it more just that they are reputable?
12:03:03 - Patron : it says at least 5 scholarly resources
12:03:38 - Patron : I can email my professor to ask if they can just be reputable as I assume its hard to find scholarly resources regarding this topic
12:05:07 - Ginny Boehme : Yes, that's the issue I'm running into. There are several reputable sites that could work, and there are probably lots of good books here in the library that will likely be useful too. But basic concepts like that are very unlikely to be discussed in a useful way in scholarly sources
12:05:34 - Ginny Boehme : Here is one of the better sites, although it's not scholarly: <a href=""https://www.fdic.gov/resources/consumers/money-smart/index.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.fdic.gov/resources/consumers/money-smart/index.html</a>
12:05:51 - Ginny Boehme : The Federal Reserve website is probably a good place to look too
12:06:05 - Ginny Boehme : let me see if I can find any articles though
12:07:13 - Patron : im sure reputable sources will work! if you have any others, I would love to have them just in case
12:08:57 - Ginny Boehme : Here are some papers that might be useful. I looked for things that mention ""financial literacy"" which should cover most of what you're looking for, and tried to limit it to review papers: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bth&amp;bquery=financial+literacy+AND+(+TI+(review)+OR+AB+(review)+)&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bth&amp;bquery=financial+literacy+AND+(+TI+(review)+OR+AB+(review)+)&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a>

12:11:27 - Ginny Boehme : But definitely talk to your professor to check if you can broaden the definition of ""scholarly"" here
12:12:05 - Patron : I will, thank you so much for you help! I sincerely appreciate your help.
12:12:11 - Patron : have a great rest of your day!
12:12:20 - Ginny Boehme : You're welcome! I hope there's something you can use in there :)

13:45:44 - Katie Gibson : on the library website, go to the Databases A-Z list

13:46:20 - Patron : I see it
13:46:32 - Patron : Thanks for your help!

14:55:00 - Patron : not necessarily.  Our assignment is to let our cohort know if these journals provide an idex.  So the question is for each journal in general.
14:55:04 - Jenny Presnell : does that link work for you?
14:55:59 - Jenny Presnell : ah
14:56:03 - Jenny Presnell : I didn't read

14:56:46 - Patron : thank you, we looked at that and could only locate references for individual articles
14:57:01 - Jenny Presnell : if it is an e-journal like the first link I sent, you should be able to search through the journal
14:57:12 - Jenny Presnell : I'll have to check to see if they are in the music indexes

14:58:04 - Patron : so a particular journal may not have its own index, but may be indexed in a broader place?
14:59:59 - Jenny Presnell : I am not sure exactly how to answer that. There are two basic ways to search for a journal article. In indexes such as Music Index, RLM Abstracts of Music -- those are probably the basic ones
15:00:15 - Jenny Presnell : they may or may not contain references to articles in the journals you mention
15:01:17 - Jenny Presnell : Many journals are electronically available and thus you can search within that journal. To see if we subscribe to those titles -- click on ejournals on the front page of the library catalog
15:01:37 - Jenny Presnell : I'll take a look to see if the journals you mention are in Music Index
15:03:26 - Jenny Presnell : all three are indexed in Music Index
15:04:10 - Jenny Presnell : Is this kind of confusing?
15:04:50 - Patron : We need to answer:
15:05:07 - Patron : Where is the journal indexed?
15:05:18 - Jenny Presnell : In an index called Music Index
15:05:51 - Jenny Presnell : and
15:06:14 - Patron : can you please send the link for that? (""Music Index"")
15:06:24 - Jenny Presnell : it looks like aslo in RLIM Abstracts of music theory

10:21:40 - Zachary Grisham : True, I would opt for Cabinet Room, Washington D.C.
10:21:56 - Zachary Grisham : But then we are not specifying which cabinet room.
10:22:02 - Zachary Grisham : Hmm, let me think o that a bit.
10:23:04 - Zachary Grisham : I think, ""White House, Cabinet Room, Washington D.C."" would be the best way to convey that. 
10:23:21 - Patron : Okay thank you!
10:23:30 - Zachary Grisham : You are welcome! Can I help with anything else?
10:24:17 - Patron : I think that's all, thanks!
10:24:35 - Zachary Grisham : Great, hope you have a wonderful day! Feel free to chat again if you need more help.

11:22:37 - Zachary Grisham : There are a couple of ways to do that. If you are looking at the library databases there are actually limiters for that on the right hand side.
11:22:50 - Zachary Grisham : If you are using a resource like google scholar it becomes a tad more annoying.
11:23:10 - Zachary Grisham : You would need to look up the journal, on their website they would explain if it is or not.
11:23:49 - Zachary Grisham : So two questions. 1) Are you using the library databases/ search tool? Are there any particular articles you are curious about?
11:23:54 - Zachary Grisham : Happy to help with either.
11:28:46 - Zachary Grisham : You still there?
11:34:36 - Patron : Yes, sorry. I don't have any sources in particular yet, but would the academic journals all be peer reviewed or is there a different limiter that I need to select?

09:36:09 - Mallory : Hello! I sent in a question last night about citing a website. It was for the Ensemble Theatre. I saw your email about how to format it correctly, but I am still a little confused
09:36:37 - Roger Justus : I dont blame you.  Citing can be a bit weird!  
09:37:10 - Mallory : The website was <a href=""https://ensemblecincinnati.org/calendar/what-the-constitution-means-to-me/"" target=""_blank"">https://ensemblecincinnati.org/calendar/what-the-constitution-means-to-me/</a>
09:37:15 - Roger Justus : right
09:37:31 - Mallory : I had both attended the production and needed to use the website for information
09:39:47 - Roger Justus : Ah ok...I get it.  So for the parts where you are using the website, you can use the (second I think) cite I sent.  But for the play itself use the other...if you are still confused we can get a zoom and I can talk rather then type this...
09:40:13 - Mallory : For the second I also had a copy of the script that I was using to cite quotes
09:40:54 - Roger Justus : Cool ok so for a script it is like this - 

<p>Author. (Year). <em>Title</em> (Editor, Ed.). Publisher.</p>Examples<p>Shakespeare, W. (2006). <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> (B. Gibbons, Ed.). Routledge. (Original work published 1623)</p>
09:41:09 - Mallory : For the first, is the group authors ""Ensemble Theatre"" supposed to be italized?
09:43:56 - Roger Justus : Ok for a play the format is similar - 

Playwright Last Name, First name. <em>Play Title</em>. City: Publisher, Year. Only the title is italized (sometimes our ticket response system messes with the formatting)
09:44:48 - Mallory : Okay, great! And then, if I am not sure of the publisher of the play, should I leave it blank?
09:46:08 - Roger Justus : Give me a moment and let me see if I can find it...its not on the script I guess?
09:47:11 - Roger Justus : <em>Theatre Communications Group</em>
09:47:17 - Roger Justus : I think that is it!

I did a sample search using terms ""retirement"" and ""identity"" and got some possible matches. You might want to limit to a period of years, perhaps the last 10 or so. You should also be able to limit to academic journals since this database includes popular magazines and other sources. Does this sound helpful?
11:26:03 - Patron : Yes, thank you very much.
11:28:34 - Barry Zaslow : You're welcome. You might try different combinations of words, too. I just put one word in the top box and asked it to search in the text and did the other word in the second box and did same. If you locate some good matches you can use the yellow Find It button if the text is not showing as a PDF or HTML on the screen. The Find it will likely tell you where it might be available online or in print and then you can try OhioLINK or Interlibrary Loan if you decide you really want that particular article
11:29:45 - Barry Zaslow : There are blue links to OhioLINK and ILL (Interlibrary Loan) on the home page of the Libraries in the middle under the big search box

• Peer-reviewed (coming from an academic peer-review journal, so not a blog post, website, etc)
• Dealing with human subjects (has a participant section and describes participants in the study)
16:00:39 - Patron : I am struggling with finding this
16:00:39 - Katie Gibson : Ah I see
16:00:58 - Katie Gibson : yes, you'll want to use a database called PsychInfo... do you know how to get to that?
16:01:06 - Patron : No
16:01:27 - Katie Gibson : Ok I'll walk you through the steps... and how to do the search to meet all those requirements
16:01:41 - Patron : Thank you I appreciate it
16:01:49 - Katie Gibson : from the library website lib.miamioh.edu, click on the databases A-Z circle, and psych info will be under P
16:01:53 - Katie Gibson : click into that
16:02:36 - Katie Gibson : let me know when you are there, and I'll tell you what to do next
16:02:55 - Patron : Okay i am there
16:03:30 - Katie Gibson : all right... so you'll first put in what topic of article you want to find in the search boxes. But then underneath those, there are a whole lot of ways to narrow the search
16:04:36 - Katie Gibson : the first requirement will be in the methodology section of the narrowers, you can pick ""empirical study""
16:04:55 - Patron : Can you give me an example? My professor was very vague about this and said to choose anything that interests me but I dont understand how to correlate that with a participation section
16:04:56 - Katie Gibson : peer reviewed you can use the publication type section to pick that
16:05:35 - Katie Gibson : the human subjects part is in the population narrower
16:05:53 - Katie Gibson : That's harder to choose... is there a psychology topic you're interested in?
16:06:11 - Patron : criminal justice
16:06:27 - Patron : or like different personality disorders
16:06:38 - Patron : but i am just so confused on how to connect that to a certain study
16:06:54 - Katie Gibson : Either one of those and the limiters I gave you should get you lots of results that will have links to the studies
16:08:31 - Patron : I cant find where it says ""empirical study""
16:09:12 - Katie Gibson : That one took me a very long time to find... one second I need to remind myself where it was
16:09:33 - Katie Gibson : OH! It was in the methodology one... at the bottom right hand side of the limiters
16:10:14 - Patron : okay got it
16:10:29 - Katie Gibson : And let me know if that gets you useful articles
16:11:15 - Katie Gibson : You'll need to click the yellow button that says ""find it"" to locate the article sometimes
16:12:41 - Patron : So just to clarify, the bottom right box that said ""Select a Field (optional)"" is supposed to say ""Methodology""?
16:13:12 - Katie Gibson : Hmm... I'm not sure what you mean. One moment, I'll record my screen to show you what I'm talking about
16:15:22 - Katie Gibson : ok, that didn't work

11:12:36 - Kristen Adams : are the hosital guidelines, like a book?
11:12:56 - Kristen Adams : I'll look and see if they mention this specifcilly or not, but in case they don't
11:13:33 - Patron : No they are written by specialists nurses, doctors and pharamacists and then go through drugs and therapeutic committee for approval.
11:14:03 - Patron : Once approved they are on the Trust intranet for all GSTT employees to look up on clinical guideance to see
11:15:34 - Kristen Adams : Ok, they don't have anything specific to this, but I'm looking at the categories and figuring out which might be best
11:15:46 - Kristen Adams : I don't think I'd class it as a website
11:15:57 - Kristen Adams : nor a book
11:16:07 - Kristen Adams : nor a dataset
11:16:38 - Kristen Adams : they have a category with guidance for ""code of ethics"" - which seems close

You can put in keywords such as ""opioid"" ""healthcare"" and perhaps a state like ""Ohio"" in the boxes and search the text. Then limit to peer reviewed by checking the box on the right. I did a sample search and got many matches but it would probably be best to also limit by years such as the last five or ten (depending on your assignment) so you don't get too many

18:25:35 - Patron : oh thank you so much ! those will work perfectly
18:25:43 - Katie Gibson : Those look like books about the building that the picture is of
18:26:32 - Patron : Yea unfortunately. I dont know if those are going to have the painting in it
18:28:35 - Katie Gibson : I'm doing some more digging
18:28:43 - Katie Gibson : but I'm not finding much on even just the artist
18:30:01 - Patron : That has been my struggle too.
18:30:27 - Katie Gibson : This one has me stumped. I'd recommend you reach out to our art librarian Stefanie Hilles
18:30:43 - Katie Gibson : she has a background in art history and might have some ideas of where and how to search
18:31:00 - Katie Gibson : hillessa@miamioh.edu

16:58:03 - Mark Dahlquist : These were found through an ""articles and more"" search. I ended up removing the term ""longitudinal"" because it seems like not all longitudinal studies include that term.<br />
16:58:46 - Mark Dahlquist : So, you might need to look at these studies and select some that measure density across time.<br />
16:59:36 - Patron : It seems like all of these are for specific insects, I want a general count.  Can you figure out a way to ask that?  Miracle work?
16:59:57 - Mark Dahlquist : Hmm. Let me take another look. Hold on a moment.<br />
17:01:29 - Patron : Researchers trapped a bunch of bugs, counted them, then found like a 75% reduction in the number several years later.

I was just sending you some suggestions. If you go to Academic Search Complete in Databases A-Z and put Jefferson Davis, New Orleans, and monument(s) in the search boxes and ask it to search TX (text) there appear to be some useful matches although I didn't look at them closely. Also, the Wikipedia article has some useful citations at the end which might give you some leads. If you are still not finding much I would reach out to Jenny Presnell, our History Librarian at presnejl@miamioh.edu. She could have other sources to recommend. Does this help? The Wikipedia article title is below in boldJefferson Davis Monument (New Orleans, Louisiana)

Could you help me with this?","","16","","16:28:08 - Mark Dahlquist : Hi, thanks for this question. I'll be happy to try to help with this, Please hold on one moment while I do some checking.<br />
16:30:44 - Mark Dahlquist : Here are some results for a search for peer-reviewed journal sources for ""toxic coaching"" or ""toxic leadership"" and sports: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;bquery=(+%26quot%3btoxic+coaching%26quot%3b+OR+%26quot%3btoxic+leadership%26quot%3b+)+AND+(+athletes+or+sports+or+athletics+)&amp;cli0=RV&amp;clv0=Y&amp;cli1=FT1&amp;clv1=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;bquery=(+%26quot%3btoxic+coaching%26quot%3b+OR+%26quot%3btoxic+leadership%26quot%3b+)+AND+(+athletes+or+sports+or+athletics+)&amp;cli0=RV&amp;clv0=Y&amp;cli1=FT1&amp;clv1=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site</a><br />
16:31:09 - Mark Dahlquist : I agree however that these results are a little scattered.<br />
16:31:46 - Patron : Yes, I was having trouble finding results and I really appreciate the help! Thank you!
16:32:46 - Mark Dahlquist : One strategy that might work here would be to find one good article and investigate the References page. This can be a good strategy for topic where there aren't very well-defined keywords.<br />
16:33:23 - Mark Dahlquist : For example, you could take a look at the 2021 article Toxic Coaching of Collegiate Student-Athletes, which seems to have a good bibliography: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edo&amp;AN=152589111&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edo&amp;AN=152589111&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site</a><br />
16:34:31 - Mark Dahlquist : If you put the title of this article into Google Scholar, you can also see that four articles have cited it since it was published.<br />
16:34:59 - Patron : Okay, I will try this strategy as well
16:35:08 - Mark Dahlquist : These articles aren't volleyball specific, but they might be useful.<br />
16:35:13 - Mark Dahlquist : I hope!<br />
16:36:06 - Patron : Yes, volleyball might be a little too specific to find an article on but I think that I should be able to find useful information from sports in general.
16:36:13 - Patron : Thank you!
16:36:33 - Mark Dahlquist : You're welcome! Feel free to check with us again if we can provide more assistance.<br />
16:36:37 - Mark Dahlquist : Have a great evening!<br />
16:36:45 - Patron : I appreciate it!

Do you know which citation format your instructor prefers?<br />
20:16:35 - Mark Dahlquist : (such as ALA, MLA, Chicago, etc.)<br />
20:16:40 - Patron : Hi, thank you. They requested MLA.
20:18:03 - Mark Dahlquist : Great; MLA uses parenthetical citations in text (rather than footnotes). A website with examples of this the Excelsior University OWL site, here: <a href=""https://owl.excelsior.edu/citation-and-documentation/mla-style/mla-in-text-citations/"" target=""_blank"">https://owl.excelsior.edu/citation-and-documentation/mla-style/mla-in-text-citations/</a><br />
20:18:38 - Mark Dahlquist : You then include a ""Works Cited"" page with the author names in alphabetical order at the end of the paper.<br />
20:19:18 - Patron : Thanks! Do you know if I'm citing from an anthology if I should use the general editors last name as the in text citation?
20:19:30 - Patron : For example, (Levine 9)
20:22:05 - Mark Dahlquist : It depends if you are citing something inside the Anthology. Probably you would want to cite the author of the work included in the anthology. So your reference in the works cited would look like this (Coleman, Wanda. ""Job Hunter."" <em>For a Living: The Poetry of Work</em>, edited by Nicholas Coles and Peter Oresick, U of Illinois P, 1995, p. 105.)

<br />
20:22:59 - Mark Dahlquist : Also, keep in mind that in MLA you don't need to include the author's name in the parenthetical citation if you have already indicated who the author is.<br />
20:23:29 - Patron : That makes sense, thanks for your help!

Childhood obesity would be in italics. My question is, do all the numbers after that go in italics as well? 

My second question is, what would I do with a website like the CDC? For example, CDC. (2022a, July 20). Obesity is a common, serious, and costly disease. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Does centers for disease.. go in italics?

12:17:27 - Abigail Morgan : Generally if you obtained it from a library source you can use it
12:18:21 - Patron : so if the source I found was a library source and it didn't have a volume or issue number I could still proceed to use it and would not lose marks on my assignment for it
12:18:50 - Abigail Morgan : Again, it depends on the source and your assignment
12:19:33 - Patron : s
12:19:51 - Abigail Morgan : It is possible what you are looking at is a book or a book chapter, which is why it doesn't have a volume or issue number
12:20:35 - Abigail Morgan : It could also be a government website or an article that was published online where the vol/iss. are not obvious
12:20:49 - Patron : Yeah sometimes its a book or a journal article
12:21:46 - Patron : thats why I wanted to just clarify if I was not to put the iss/vol number would it make the source not credible
12:22:00 - Abigail Morgan : Do you have a link to the resource?
12:24:02 - Patron : Not at the moment , I was just having a recap of referencing and when it came to my assignments that was one of my weak points because their are times when some of my resources that I find don't have a vol/iss number  and I was confused on what to do ?
12:24:18 - Abigail Morgan : Ah I see.
12:25:00 - Abigail Morgan : Then yes, vol/and issue are the end all be all of credibility. If you are getting your resources from a library database or other trusted information source, then you should be ok
12:25:18 - Abigail Morgan : Also vol/iss are not required in APA for all types of citations
12:25:59 - Patron : yeah just for journal articles and books if I'm correct?
12:26:34 - Abigail Morgan : yes for journal articles. For books, you will need the publisher and date of publication
12:28:30 - Patron : So just to clarify vol/issue number are needed for the credibility , so if not I should find another source
12:29:19 - Abigail Morgan : Yes, unless your professor specifically states that you must use only books and journal articles, you should be fine
12:30:10 - Patron : Thank you because I always thought that if the vol/iss number was not incld
12:30:20 - Patron : included it will be okay
12:30:30 - Patron : but now you have made it much clearer thank you
12:30:54 - Abigail Morgan : You're welcome, I'm glad I could help!
12:31:27 - Patron : Sorry one last question
12:31:42 - Abigail Morgan : sure
12:32:10 - Patron : Do you think its better to write out my references or use a website that helps generate them for you , if so do you have any you recommend
12:33:46 - Abigail Morgan : I like doing it by hand, but I am old and that's how I learned. I like zbib.org or citefast.com - they usually get the formatting closest to correct
12:34:20 - Abigail Morgan : Generally I put in the source to one of those and then fix any errors I find by hand
12:37:42 - Patron : and if I do have a source and I find a quote and I paraphrase would I still include the page numbers with my references  even though I've paraphrased and change it into my own words
12:39:32 - Abigail Morgan : if you quote something directly you have to cite to the page number. if you are just summarizing and paraphrasing the overall argument, you cite just the author &amp; date. 
12:43:47 - Patron : okay then thank you so much , this has really helped
12:44:03 - Abigail Morgan : Great! Have a nice day

13:14:15 - Patron : Looking to sit down with one in the library, will be visiting the library around 3 today.
13:14:53 - Zachary Grisham : Gotcha, so you might ask up at special collections if you want a really old one. They might request you make an appointment but it might be worth it. 
13:15:14 - Zachary Grisham : It seems they are scattered throughout the library depending on what subject you are interested in. 
13:15:23 - Zachary Grisham : Are you interested in any specific subject? 
13:18:07 - Patron : Specifically looking for the oldest world maps I can find. will definitely be asking at special collections, thank you for looking.
13:18:33 - Zachary Grisham : You are welcome. I found a bit more if you have another moment.
13:19:13 - Zachary Grisham : It looks like a lot of them can be found in the G section. Here is a more specific search but it uncovered some actually in the stacks.

13:20:12 - Zachary Grisham : (Which our stacks are catalogued under)
13:20:33 - Zachary Grisham : So quick summary, G would be a great place to start looking. For extremely old ones ask special collections.

MRI Simmons insights will give you that specific data though. Have you used that one?
13:33:29 - Patron : I did look into that one but I felt like I had less luck on that site because I was unable to even find a beer market.
13:33:59 - Zachary Grisham : That database focuses on specific brands more. So you could find out information specifically about consumers who drink Bud Light.
13:34:14 - Zachary Grisham : Give me a moment.
13:34:22 - Zachary Grisham : Will pull it up and see what I can find.
13:34:57 - Patron : Okay thankyou, I am looking for Budweiser specifically, but now the site is telling me that too many people are logged in at the moment.
13:35:34 - Zachary Grisham : Yep, that is unfortunate. Just happened to me as well.

13:36:05 - Patron : Okay
13:40:47 - Zachary Grisham : You are correct, there is nothing in Mintel to create a consumer profile using only budweiser. Only thing it refers to that brand specifically seems to have to due with volume.

13:42:41 - Patron : Yes that would be great. Anything helps I've been out of luck so far

13:43:00 - Zachary Grisham : Exploring their consumer insights section. 
13:43:18 - Zachary Grisham : It will not be as good as MRI but it might do for basic needs until you can access that database.
13:44:22 - Patron : I looked into that and I found a report on InBev and Anheuser Busch brand sales but nothing specifically on consumer demographics,  please let me know if you have better luck,
13:44:34 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, one moment. 
13:47:52 - Zachary Grisham : Well, they put that section of Statista behind a paywall it seems. However, you will be happy to hear I found budweiser in MRI Simmons. Do you know how to read clickstreams? If so, would you like one to access the MRI consumer profiles on people who have drank budweiser in the past week?
13:48:41 - Zachary Grisham : I would also be happy to zoom to show you where the information is nested. If that would be easier for you.
13:50:13 - Patron : yes that would be great I can zoom, I still don't have access to simmons

17:34:24 - Patron : Yes
17:35:08 - Zachary Grisham : Great, we can definitely do that, where have you searched thus? 
17:35:12 - Zachary Grisham : far?
17:36:36 - Zachary Grisham : You still there?

17:41:15 - Zachary Grisham : *either.
17:48:36 - Patron : Sorry about that, but I honestly don't have an idea yet of what I want to research.
17:49:11 - Zachary Grisham : That is ok, what class is it? 
17:49:37 - Zachary Grisham : We could look at databases in the discipline, see the subject keywords and maybe something will pop out as interesting to you.
17:49:49 - Patron : English 101
17:50:14 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, those assignments tend to vary. What is the assignment? 
17:50:37 - Patron : It is for an annotated bibliography
17:51:21 - Zachary Grisham : Yep, I meant, many times assignments will say creating an annotated bibliography on a list of subjects.
17:51:31 - Zachary Grisham : Is there a list of subjects?
17:51:52 - Patron : Yea its not list I can discuss any topic I choose.
17:52:21 - Zachary Grisham : Well that makes life easy for you. What is your major? Maybe you can find an interest there.
17:52:51 - Patron : Yes that would be great I am majoring in Sports Leadership and Management
17:53:11 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, that is cool. You could do research on some aspect of sports. 
17:53:22 - Zachary Grisham : Let me take a glance and see what databases we have on that subject.
17:53:37 - Patron : Ok sounds good
17:56:30 - Zachary Grisham : Alright, so it looks like we have tons on the topic.
17:56:48 - Zachary Grisham : Let me try and figure out a path real quick to gain background on it before I share 
17:57:21 - Patron : Ok
17:59:50 - Zachary Grisham : Alright, so I think a good place to start may be just getting some background in a reference resource. 
18:00:07 - Zachary Grisham : As an example, Gale opposing viewpoints has a section on Sports &amp; Athletes.
18:00:33 - Zachary Grisham : It has some reference on the topic, what is trending right now, opposing viewpoints then a list of articles related to the topic.
18:00:57 - Zachary Grisham : <u><a href=""https://link.gale.com/apps/portal/00000000LVVE/OVIC?u=muohio_main&amp;sid=bookmark-OVIC&amp;xid=fa7273a7"" target=""_blank"">https://link.gale.com/apps/portal/00000000LVVE/OVIC?u=muohio_main&amp;sid=bookmark-OVIC&amp;xid=fa7273a7</a></u><br />
18:01:28 - Zachary Grisham : Maybe it will give you some ideas about what is going on in the field, so you can choose some keywords for searching articles.
18:01:50 - Zachary Grisham : Let me snag another resource or two.
18:01:55 - Patron : OK I appreciate it
18:04:16 - Zachary Grisham : Then there is Oxford very short introductions.
18:04:17 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1093/actrade/9780199688340.001.0001"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.1093/actrade/9780199688340.001.0001</a>
18:04:33 - Zachary Grisham : It will talk about the history of sports, what is going on somewhat recently.... etc...
18:04:40 - Zachary Grisham : But the main thing is trying to find keywords. 
18:04:57 - Zachary Grisham : Once you find keywords you can then start really searching for useful articles for your annotated bibliography.
18:05:17 - Zachary Grisham : As an example, let us say you decide to just do a broad search of sports leadership.
18:05:41 - Zachary Grisham : You could type in ""Sports"" AND ""leadership"" into the library search tool.
18:05:48 - Zachary Grisham : Which would give you this.
18:06:08 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://eds.s.ebscohost.com/plink?key=100.69.12.106_8000_1730532736&amp;scope=site&amp;site=eds-live&amp;bquery=sports+AND+leadership&amp;uquery=sports+AND+leadership&amp;search_prefix=&amp;submit=+"" target=""_blank"">https://eds.s.ebscohost.com/plink?key=100.69.12.106_8000_1730532736&amp;scope=site&amp;site=eds-live&amp;bquery=sports+AND+leadership&amp;uquery=sports+AND+leadership&amp;search_prefix=&amp;submit=+</a>
18:06:49 - Zachary Grisham : Then limiting to only academic journals using the limiter on the left hand side.
18:07:13 - Patron : got it
18:07:20 - Zachary Grisham : Then you would get this.

18:08:13 - Zachary Grisham : Anyways, what I am trying to get at is. Once you do some background research to find what interests you, then you can use keywords to find articles on the topic using the library search tool.
18:08:25 - Zachary Grisham : Does that make sense?
18:09:36 - Patron : yes
18:09:45 - Zachary Grisham : Was that helpful at all?
18:10:07 - Patron : Forsure thank you
18:10:30 - Zachary Grisham : You are welcome! Feel free to chat again if you have difficulties later. Hope you have a good night!

How can I help you decide? Let me see what kind of background information I can find and then I'll link you? 
10:06:09 - Patron : OK thank you, I feel like these topics are to broad I need help narrowing them down. But I want to make sure I find enough quality sources for my paper.
10:06:45 - Nate Floyd : For sure. Is there a particular argument or angle you need to take on one of these topics? 
10:06:56 - Patron : Here are my topic proposals I sent to my professor and her comments: An issue I am interested in exploring is the violence that has been recently taking place in my hometown community of Bolingbrook, Illinois. This is a community I belong to and was associated with at birth, the violence is affecting the community as a whole because it used to be a very safe environment for everyone but now people cannot be at ease when out and around there because of the fear of losing their life. This is something that we didn't have to worry about years before so we need to find out what happens and what we need to do in order to improve. People should care about this issue because it is breaking down the community, and being able to solve this will give people hope of getting it back to the way it was. This issue in the community is something I am tied to because I have always been a part of it, I was able to see where a switch was flipped and how it all changed. Also, the violence is connected to the younger generation because most of the violence is to be seen by them or they are the main ones affected by it. Social media as a whole and how it is used by some people i see is a problem because certain individuals will use social media or it would just influence them to do something that they know they shouldn't for the views or fame. I feel this issue could be too wide at some points, but I could bring in a lot of information if I needed to write a research paper on it.




Another issue I would like to discuss is the diversity around campus, I feel this is something this community here in Oxford lacks a lot and that is a diverse environment. This impacts the community because it limits people's able to be open to learning about different backgrounds and lifestyles of people who differ from them. The statistics show that seventy-six percent of people are white Americans, ten percent of people are Asian, and there are only five percent of people are African Americans. I know things here have been like this for a long time and u i feel other people here might feel it is not a problem because this is something that have gotten used to and they won't see the same problem. I feel I am personally related to this issue because I am a part of the minority group of people that are here, I learned about this issue by just being around campus there is an obvious difference between races. I am hoping to learn more ways we can be able to expand the community by adding more diversi
10:07:18 - Patron : Hello Mekhi, 

Both of your proposals have potential for a solid research paper. 

In your first proposal, you need to be more specific about what's causing the uptick in violence in your community, as well as the specific kind of violence you want to address, so you can narrow down the issue. Alternatively, you could focus on solving one of the factors causing the violence (e.g. lack of youth services/programs, unemployment, lack of affordable housing, etc.). Any one of these factors can be its own separate issue that you can write about. 

When choosing which of these two topics to research, consider doing some light research in Google Scholar to get a sense of what's available in terms of credible sources for your topic. 

For your final draft of this paper, make sure that you're answering all the required questions in the Topic Proposals final draft assignment. Also format your paper in MLA just like you did with the Rhetorical Analysis (add your name, instructor's name, course title, and date on the left side, 12 pt Times New Roman, and include a paper title).

Reach out if you have any questions or would like to talk more about your chosen topic.

I am Jeneva Cercado, a student from West Visayas State University in the Philippines. I am currently in my third year as a Library and Information Science student and currently working on a study/ research regarding the uses of augmented reality in libraries. While searching for information on augmented reality in libraries, I have found out that your library has embraced AR to create engaging and interactive experiences for their visitors, thus, I am hoping if is it possible to have an interview with one of the librarians regarding this matter? If given the chance, I'll gladly send a letter for formality in request of an interview. 

Thank you and have a great day!","","13","","11:34:01 - Nate Floyd : Hello. Do you have a particular librarian in mind?
11:34:37 - Patron : no, however, do you have any recommendation?
11:35:48 - Nate Floyd : I'm not aware of any librarian working with augmented reality, though there may well be a librarian here who does that. I'm not familiar with everyone's area of work. If you can share the information you found saying that our library does AR, I might be able to guess who it is.

15:55:03 - Patron : Okay thank you
15:55:06 - Zachary Grisham : Turns out the first book is ""Carnival Music in Trinidad
15:55:13 - Zachary Grisham : Did some background research.
15:55:33 - Zachary Grisham : Calypso music is popular during carnival
15:55:36 - Patron : Yes that is one book I am interested in but it is only available at the Middletown and Hamilton campus.  I will keep looking
15:55:49 - Zachary Grisham : Actually, it is in the music library.
15:55:57 - Zachary Grisham : It is right down the road from King.
15:56:11 - Zachary Grisham : If you request it they should have it for you quite soon.
15:56:17 - Patron : Oh okay I didn't realize that was a separate location
15:56:50 - Zachary Grisham : There should be more on the topic.
15:57:00 - Patron : Okay I will keep searching.
15:57:10 - Zachary Grisham : Well, did you notice the subject term?
15:57:15 - Zachary Grisham : That will be very helpful.
15:57:27 - Zachary Grisham : You can click on that one, then it will pull all books on that subject.
15:57:52 - Zachary Grisham : Oh, nevermind, seems like that is the only one on the topic. 
15:57:56 - Patron : Okay that helps
15:57:58 - Zachary Grisham : You might also want to try reference resources.
15:58:13 - Zachary Grisham : Maybe in the Oxford Short histories?
15:58:26 - Patron : Okay thank you
15:58:46 - Zachary Grisham : You are welcome. Would you like me to look? Or do you wish to explore it yourself?
15:59:04 - Patron : If you are able that would be great
15:59:14 - Zachary Grisham : Will do, give me a moment.
16:03:43 - Zachary Grisham : Does it have to be a book? Or are you also accepting of other resources?
16:05:40 - Patron : Books or journal/articles are best
16:10:41 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, I found some things. Harder than I thought though. I can see why you had trouble. 
16:11:29 - Zachary Grisham : Are you willing to request some of them via ILL?
16:13:03 - Zachary Grisham : And we do have some things available via JStOR as well.
16:13:12 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/jstor"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/jstor</a>
16:13:35 - Patron : I am not sure I know what ILL means to be honest.  This is my first time using the university library
16:15:05 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, great. To give you some background. The search portal is available via the library webpage. Also on that webpage is an A-Z list of databases. When I failed to find anything on the library search portal I used a specific database which I linked above. That seems to have quite a bit on the topic of calypso in Trinidad. 
16:15:12 - Zachary Grisham : ILL is Interlibrary loan. 
16:15:32 - Zachary Grisham : It allows you to search through other universities holdings and request their resources as well.
16:15:55 - Patron : Okay that makes sense.   Yes I am willing to do that
16:16:12 - Zachary Grisham : Great, let us see if there is enough information in our own collections first though.
16:16:17 - Zachary Grisham : For example
16:16:23 - Zachary Grisham : this was in JSTOR
16:16:24 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/1214859"" target=""_blank"">https://www.jstor.org/stable/1214859</a>
16:17:05 - Patron : Yes that looks helpful
16:17:08 - Zachary Grisham : Their is actually a section called ""The roots of carnival and calypso
16:17:25 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, then using the database JSTOR search Calypso and Trinidad. 
16:17:36 - Zachary Grisham : You will get that in the search results as well as quite a few others.
16:17:52 - Patron : Ok that is helpful
16:21:03 - Zachary Grisham : Is steel band music the same as calypso?
16:21:36 - Patron : Calypso is a musical genre and steel pan is an instrument often used in Calypso music
16:23:06 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, on that article ""Carnival, Calypso, and Steelband in Trinidad"" There are a few references that might be useful to you.
16:23:26 - Zachary Grisham : They should be under ""references"" on the left hand side.
16:23:41 - Patron : Ok yes I see them.  Thank you
16:23:42 - Zachary Grisham : For example, ""Fort years of calypso"" might be useful to you.
16:25:14 - Patron : Ok thank you
16:25:30 - Zachary Grisham : Or possible this one?
16:25:39 - Zachary Grisham : If you wanted you could request this dissertation.
16:25:39 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://www.proquest.com/docview/302703656?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;fromopenview=true"" target=""_blank"">https://www.proquest.com/docview/302703656?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;fromopenview=true</a>
16:25:55 - Zachary Grisham : Anyways, don't mean to overwhelm you. 
16:26:01 - Zachary Grisham : Have you found enough to start?
16:26:35 - Patron : Yes I think so. Thank you so much for pointing me toward all this.
16:26:48 - Zachary Grisham : You are welcome, hope you have a wonderful evening!
16:26:57 - Zachary Grisham : Let us know if we can be of further assistance.

About the people who had control at that time and the people who were the biggest influencers on politics?","","62","","17:15:34 - Zachary Grisham : Hello! I would look for a history of the Congo if I were you.
17:15:53 - Zachary Grisham : Are you only looking for articles or do books/ reference resources work as well.
17:15:54 - Zachary Grisham : ?
17:16:26 - Patron : Articles would be best unless if its a short book.
17:16:50 - Patron : Do you know what the best why to go about looking it up would be?
17:17:10 - Zachary Grisham : I would look up a country profile.
17:17:18 - Zachary Grisham : As an example, here is one from britannica
17:17:24 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/place/Democratic-Republic-of-the-Congo/The-Congo-crisis"" target=""_blank"">https://www.britannica.com/place/Democratic-Republic-of-the-Congo/The-Congo-crisis</a>
17:17:35 - Zachary Grisham : It is specifically looking at the congo crisis.
17:17:44 - Zachary Grisham : Which seems to be around that time.
17:18:25 - Zachary Grisham : If you look to the left, the history tab.
17:18:35 - Zachary Grisham : It will have Belgian patern.....
17:19:01 - Zachary Grisham : That is the section talking about how Belgian recognized independence.
17:19:11 - Zachary Grisham : However, we can find more information as well.
17:19:27 - Patron : okay thank you.  But would there be a scholarly article that i can look up?
17:19:27 - Zachary Grisham : Let us see if we can find something short to give you a good amount of information
17:19:57 - Zachary Grisham : Yep, definitely possible. That was an encyclopedia.
17:20:04 - Zachary Grisham : Wiull look for scholarly article.
17:20:14 - Zachary Grisham : The difficulty with them is they tend to be extremely specific.
17:20:31 - Patron : Yes i had that difficulty too
17:22:20 - Patron : Does research guide help with looking up articles?
17:22:55 - Zachary Grisham : Yep, research guides are meant for you to have resources on specific subjects. Such as economics, history, etc...
17:23:05 - Zachary Grisham : It gives you databases and resources specific to the subject.
17:23:21 - Zachary Grisham : However, I am betting you will only find books on the topic.
17:23:30 - Zachary Grisham : You could read a specific chapter
17:23:38 - Zachary Grisham : Would not have to read the entire book.
17:24:14 - Zachary Grisham : But, the more I look the more I am coming to believe that there will not be a generic article on the history of the Congo. It will be specifically on one aspect of that time period.
17:24:46 - Zachary Grisham : Well, maybe JSTOR might have something.
17:27:04 - Patron : So you don't think I could find something about the policial leaders at that time?
17:27:15 - Zachary Grisham : Definitely could!
17:27:25 - Zachary Grisham : But it is most likely going to be in a book. 
17:27:38 - Zachary Grisham : However, we might get lucky with and find a journal article.
17:28:11 - Zachary Grisham : Still looking around.
17:28:14 - Zachary Grisham : One moment.
17:28:27 - Patron : okay thank you!
17:29:35 - Zachary Grisham : Well, would you look at that. You were right.
17:29:38 - Zachary Grisham : I found something.

17:29:55 - Zachary Grisham : Can you access that?
17:30:00 - Patron : Oh perfect!
17:30:45 - Patron : yes I can thank you!
17:30:48 - Zachary Grisham : If so, is that what you were looking for? It seems to be talking about the parties from that time period, their support, etc... as well as being pretty short.
17:31:36 - Patron : Yes that looks right
17:31:48 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, want to look at it and let me know if you need any more help?
17:32:24 - Zachary Grisham : Well, here is another one.
17:32:26 - Zachary Grisham : One moent.
17:32:43 - Patron : And how did you find those rescourses?
17:32:55 - Zachary Grisham : Here is the one in JSTOR
17:32:56 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/2934325"" target=""_blank"">https://www.jstor.org/stable/2934325</a>
17:33:55 - Zachary Grisham : So, I searched in JSTOR
17:34:08 - Zachary Grisham : using politics AND 1959 AND Congo.
17:34:12 - Zachary Grisham : Then I used google scholar.
17:34:22 - Zachary Grisham : Fun resource that is helpful if you want to see what is out there.
17:34:27 - Zachary Grisham : Using the same search terms.
17:34:57 - Zachary Grisham : There is the search in google scholar
17:34:58 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C36&amp;q=political+leader+AND+congo+AND+1959&amp;btnG="" target=""_blank"">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C36&amp;q=political+leader+AND+congo+AND+1959&amp;btnG=</a>
17:35:45 - Zachary Grisham : Does that help?
17:35:54 - Patron : oh okay Im looking for history before the 1960 independance
17:36:25 - Zachary Grisham : I would then change 1959 to 195 
17:36:34 - Zachary Grisham : That will pick up all of the 50's
17:36:44 - Patron : But yes that helps! i think I can find it on my own now. Thank you so much!
17:37:09 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, let me know if I can be of help in the future! If not, hope you have a wonderful evening.

17:40:09 - Patron : Awesome, thank you!
17:40:15 - Zachary Grisham : That is an intriguing research question. 
17:40:23 - Zachary Grisham : I am sure we can find quite a bit on the subject.
17:40:44 - Zachary Grisham : Where have you searched thus far? Just so I do not replicate your work.
17:41:22 - Patron : I've searched using One Search by searching Job Title, Employee Satisfaction and Employee Engagement.
17:41:45 - Zachary Grisham : Great, good start. I found one that might be useful.
17:41:48 - Patron : The most relevant thing I've found was this:
Dwivedi, S. (2022). Job titles and job satisfaction: An ethno-phenomenological inquiry with reference to a transportation and utility firm. International Journal of Business Anthropology, 12(1). <a href=""https://doi.org/10.33423/ijba.v12i1.5259"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.33423/ijba.v12i1.5259</a>
17:41:57 - Zachary Grisham : That is what I just found!
17:42:01 - Patron : Lol!
17:42:12 - Zachary Grisham : Alright, have you looked at the citations and references?
17:42:23 - Zachary Grisham : You can usually find helpful stuff in what they have cited and who cited them
17:42:57 - Patron : It's good, the tricky part for me is I'm looking at software testers/QA and I worry that the difference in role (technology professional vs trucking) may have an impact.
17:43:11 - Patron : I haven't gone through their citations. I don't know why I didn't think to do that.
17:43:33 - Zachary Grisham : It is ok, it is also helpful to look at their subject headings.
17:43:59 - Zachary Grisham : For example, in BSC that article is catalogued under ""job title"" AND ""job satisfaction""
17:44:20 - Zachary Grisham : That means if we use those subject terms we can find other articles catalogued under the same thing.
17:44:26 - Zachary Grisham : For example, I then found this.

17:44:52 - Zachary Grisham : Looks like a  trade journal.
17:45:58 - Patron : I look at that one. It's just a bit light on content. It's about 1/4 of page one.
17:46:05 - Patron : *looked

17:46:17 - Zachary Grisham : It says that salesman cared quite a bit about titles.

17:46:42 - Zachary Grisham : I think that one may be useful if we look at who cited it.
17:46:55 - Zachary Grisham : Let me take a moment to answer another patron then I can look into who cited these resources. 
17:47:02 - Zachary Grisham : Maybe give us some better content!
17:52:49 - Zachary Grisham : Have you tried google scholar at all?
17:52:53 - Zachary Grisham : I found a few things there as well.
17:53:26 - Patron : I did, also, I found a few really useful things in the citations on the article we were talking about. So I think I'm good :)
17:53:41 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, here is a list just in case.

17:53:57 - Patron : Thank you for your help! I think I got overwhelmed and it stopped critical thinking lol
17:54:27 - Zachary Grisham : No problem, happy to help! Any of those articles in that list can be requested via ILL if you end up wanting them,.
17:54:32 - Patron : The first one on your results is super cool! Okay, this is going to work :)
17:55:16 - Patron : Awesome, I might be able to get through another channel too if I need to. Taylor and Francis is a customer of mine and gave me a membership.
17:56:01 - Zachary Grisham : Great! Good luck then, feel free to reach out again if I can be of further help to you. I think you have access to quite a bit of Taylor and Francis content through Miami's library as well btw.

I would suggest The MLA International Bibliography and also some under Literary/Literature (you may have to experiment with a few of these to see what you get).

I did a basic search in the MLA one and limited to 2013-2023 and still got over 500 options so you might want to narrow things down a bit. Perhaps you can choose an aspect of the play or character.

I see that the Mac computer lab is under renovations right now. Do you know the renovation will be done, or will there be a different place to use the Mac? I need to use a program that is only installed on those labs for my class. Thank you","","16","","16:21:39 - Stefanie Hilles : Let me check for you. What program do you need?
16:25:38 - Stefanie Hilles : Hi, Valerie. Are you still there?
16:31:18 - Patron : Sorry, I didn't get the notification.
16:31:29 - Patron : Are you still here? The program that I need is XCode
16:31:51 - Stefanie Hilles : Yes. I am still here. Thank you for answering the question. 
16:32:11 - Stefanie Hilles : Next question, are you taking about the CIM lab in King Library?
16:32:42 - Patron : I think so, it's the lab with lots of Mac computers to the left of the library when you first walk in
16:33:00 - Stefanie Hilles : It looks like there are also computers with Xcode on the 2nd floor of King
16:33:34 - Patron : great, i'll check it out. Is it all the Mac on 2nd floor that has it?
16:34:28 - Stefanie Hilles : I don't know, honestly. I am reading this information off the library website, which says, ""Logger Pro (King Library Second Floor only), Xcode (King Kamm Lab and King Second Floor only). (Additional titles such as MATLAB, SPSS, and Xcode are avaiable for you to add to library computers using the Self-Service software install on campus Macs.)""
16:35:06 - Stefanie Hilles : So, it sounds like even if that mac doesn't have xcode, it can be downloaded to one
16:35:17 - Patron : sounds good, thank you so much!

The newspaper doesn't appear to be available digitally on the broadly accessible World Wide Web, nor via the Library of Congress's ""Chronicling America"" archive, nor in the Miami-accessible databases I've thought to look at (Early American Newspapers, American Periodicals, or Accessible Archives). It appears, though, that some libraries hold copies on microfilm. If I know the date of the article I'm looking for, is it possible to use ILL to request a scan from microfilm, or to request the microfilm itself through ILL?","","16","","10:51:55 - Zachary Grisham : Hey Charles, I can help you with this. Yep, both should be possible.
10:52:24 - Zachary Grisham : Just matters the lending policy of the library you are requesting from.
10:52:46 - Zachary Grisham : In my experience, they allow microfilm to be lended usually but only allow it to be used in the library.
10:52:57 - Zachary Grisham : *Most of the time.
10:52:59 - Patron : Good to know! So I just submit a request through ILL, as if for a journal or magazine article?
10:53:08 - Zachary Grisham : That is a good question.
10:53:16 - Zachary Grisham : Let me take a look at how ours is set up.
10:53:46 - Zachary Grisham : Could you give me the record you were referring to. The microfilm
10:53:49 - Zachary Grisham : ?
10:54:57 - Patron : The newspaper is called Charter Oak (Hartford, Conn.). The article I'm looking for is from February 12, 1846. Library of Congress lists libraries in which the microfilm is available (https://www.loc.gov/item/sn92051242/)
10:56:14 - Zachary Grisham : Alright, got it. Give me a moment to figure out the correct process.
10:56:30 - Patron : I can give a little fuller bibliographic info for the article as needed.
10:56:44 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, that might be helpful. Thank you!\<br />
10:57:08 - Patron : Augustus Washington to the Reverend Theodore Sedgwick Wright, January 15, 1846, Charter Oak (Hartford), February 12, 1846, p. 2.
11:03:05 - Zachary Grisham : Hmm, I can see why you had a bit of trouble. Am looking through our ILL procedure and it looks like there is not a specific section for Newspapers. That is why it is taking me a bit.
11:03:17 - Zachary Grisham : Please give me a bit longer.

11:51:03 - Patron : is there a cost if you go over the time for study rooms &amp; don't return the key on time? i think I've seen something saying that
11:51:46 - Kristen Adams : I'm not sure, let me check
11:52:51 - Patron : ok
11:53:32 - Kristen Adams : The circulation desk say that there is a fee for not returning the key on time, yes
11:54:13 - Patron : do you know how much it is?
11:54:33 - Kristen Adams : the desk says it's a dollar a day
11:56:03 - Kristen Adams : however they will likely come to the room if you don't return the key on time, as often there are other bookings
11:57:28 - Patron : ok thank you so much!

12:44:04 - Patron : i dont have a specific topic she just old us to choose three topics to write about
12:45:05 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I think it's probably a good idea to come up with a topic first so you know what kind of information you need to find. What is your class about? It might be helpful to explore Points of View which give you ideas on different topics to look into: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/points-of-view-reference-center"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/points-of-view-reference-center</a>
12:47:05 - Patron : family issues would be a good one
12:47:51 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Okay great! There are links there that dive into more specific topics under family issues. Are there any there that you find interesting? 
12:48:38 - Jaclyn Spraetz : If you click on one of those links it will take you to finding more information about that topic as well as other sources to look into under the ""bibliography"" section
12:49:13 - Patron : yes
12:49:24 - Patron : are they real articles ?
12:50:37 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Yes, they are library sources that give general information about a topic. If you are interested in one of those topics and need to find actual articles, you can search for those in ""articles and more"" or other databases on family issues. Here is a research guide that links you to other sources to search: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/fsw"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/fsw</a> (this guide is on Family Science and Social Work)

12:53:12 - Patron : 1.Balancing Work and Family
12:53:29 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Okay, thanks! Let me see what I can find
12:54:15 - Patron : 2. the second one is in women issues and is the body image &amp; media
12:54:19 - Jaclyn Spraetz : What kind of articles do you need to find? For example news articles or academic articles? 
12:56:11 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Depending on your assignment, I would probably stick to one topic. Is your professor wanting you to find sources on different topics? 
12:57:04 - Patron : no, not different topics
12:57:34 - Patron : she didnt specific said news or academic articles
12:57:38 - Jaclyn Spraetz : It might be a better idea to stick with one topic

13:02:00 - Jaclyn Spraetz : This makes the results more specific 
13:02:18 - Jaclyn Spraetz : You may want to look even more specifically into social media or even a specific form of social media like TikTok or Instagram for example
13:03:05 - Patron : yeah that was what i was thinking about
13:03:10 - Patron : sounds good
13:04:10 - Jaclyn Spraetz : If you switch out ""media"" in that original search with one of those other terms, you will be able to find articles more specifically on that. For example here are results where I removed ""media"" and added ""instagram"": <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;bquery=women+and+%26quot%3bbody+image%26quot%3b+and+instagram&amp;cli0=FT1&amp;clv0=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;bquery=women+and+%26quot%3bbody+image%26quot%3b+and+instagram&amp;cli0=FT1&amp;clv0=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site</a>
13:09:42 - Patron : oo
13:10:05 - Patron : and instead of putting instagram i can put tiktok etc?
13:10:30 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Yeah, you can try tiktok in the search and see what articles it brings up
13:11:31 - Jaclyn Spraetz : It looks like it brings up some really good ones

11:16:48 - Barry Zaslow : OK. Here are two databases I would suggest using: SportDiscus and Business Source Complete. These are in Databases A-Z, a section on the library home page <a href=""http://www.lib.miamioh.edu"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lib.miamioh.edu</a>. You can put NHL and marketing or another word in the search boxes and ask it to find those words in the text. You can also limit to years, language, and peer-reviewed (scholarly). Does this sound useful?
11:18:20 - Barry Zaslow : Many of the articles have PDF full text you can read online (I did a sample search in SportDiscus limiting to the last 10 years and got many results)
11:18:21 - Patron : perfect, thank you very much

11:46:16 - Barry Zaslow : So it says you asked for the book on OhioLINK and they have it at Defiance College and it will be sent to King Library. You should get a notice (e-mail) when it is ready. It usually takes about four-five days. Does this make sense now?
11:47:18 - Patron : Yes! I was confused about how I would be informed. Thanks Barry!
11:47:57 - Patron : Another Question
11:48:12 - Barry Zaslow : That's OK. There are a lot of ways to get titles now and each one has its own procedure. If you don't hear something by the end of the week you can give King Circulation a call at 513-529-4141.
11:49:32 - Patron : If I send someone my record number, is he allowed to collect the book from King?
11:50:55 - Barry Zaslow : You can ask the staff there to put that person's name in your circulation record ahead of time (at the above phone #) so they will know he has your permission. People do that a lot of their spouse or children. Does this help?

12:22:35 - Patron : We are working on a project to incorporate pedlialyte into cruise ships and I would like to know if you could help me find research on how to get our product on the ship so we can sell it.
12:25:00 - Nate Floyd : Hi Abi, I've got a business student question here I'm not quite sure how to get started....
12:25:19 - Nate Floyd : Ooops haha. I'm talking to our business librarian. One second....
12:26:58 - Nate Floyd : Have you seen the business research guide?
12:27:08 - Patron : I have not
12:27:23 - Nate Floyd : OK, I'm going to transfer you to our business librarian, Abi, who is on chat. One second.....
12:28:08 - Abigail Morgan : Hi Ruben!
12:29:00 - Abigail Morgan : I'm just reading over the transcript
12:29:25 - Abigail Morgan : I think SRDS might have some information on out-of-home advertising that might include cruise ships, so I'm looking that up now
12:29:28 - Patron : Hello Abi. I am working on a project for Abbott and we had an idea about incorporating pedialyte onto cruise ships in order to get more product growth. But we are sturggling to see exactly how we could do that
12:31:30 - Abigail Morgan : <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/srds-media-solutions"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/srds-media-solutions</a>
12:31:51 - Abigail Morgan : If you click on the OOH tab, you can see what options are available
12:34:15 - Patron : Would there be any information about exactly how to get on the boats? We realized that some companies are partnered with Pensi and Coca-Cola. And that they may have a contract with them abotu not being able to sell any of their competitor's products.
12:36:27 - Abigail Morgan : That was my hope. I'm not seeing anything exactly like, but it is possible they are putting cruise ships in a broader category. You might also think about ways to potentially partner with cruise trade associations. <a href=""https://cruising.org/en/"" target=""_blank"">https://cruising.org/en/</a> or 

<a href=""https://cruiseindustrynews.com/cruise-industry-advertising/"" target=""_blank"">https://cruiseindustrynews.com/cruise-industry-advertising/</a>
12:38:36 - Patron : So we should find cruise lines that don't already have a partnership and try and partner with them?
12:39:08 - Abigail Morgan : <a href=""https://www.carnival.com/about-carnival/legal-notice/ad-choice-policy"" target=""_blank"">https://www.carnival.com/about-carnival/legal-notice/ad-choice-policy</a> - it looks like cruise companies also directly sell ads through their websites and apps too, although that might not help if you are trying to get physical product placement
12:41:46 - Abigail Morgan : Yeah, that is one way you can approach it. You can try to figure out which ones are the more family friendly lines to narrow it down. 
12:42:05 - Patron : Ohh ok. Thank you!

11:05:26 - Patron : Hi, me again.  I can't find help on how to format the annotation part of a citation.  Here's an example: (The second line is the beginning of my annotation)
11:06:06 - Patron : Cheng, William. Loving Music Till It Hurts. Oxford University Press. 2019.
Chapter 4 discusses overcoming physical and mental challenges, particularlly describing exploitation on reality TV. Chapter 5 confronts public shaming. In the “Postlude” he explores those who walk away from music and the effects
     of that choice.
11:07:06 - Nate Floyd : OK cool. Here's guide that includes a sample page with annotations: <a href=""https://libguides.enc.edu/writing_basics/annotatedbib/chicago"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.enc.edu/writing_basics/annotatedbib/chicago</a>

11:09:11 - Nate Floyd : Oh, I was just Googling ""Chicago style annotation."" As far as I'm aware, there is no specific way to do an annotation in any particular style. But, I think your instructor is saying, do the annotation, and use Chicago style on the citations. Does that make sense&gt;

15:43:51 - Mark Dahlquist : Possibly yes, but sometimes this can be a bit tricky.<br />
15:45:18 - Mark Dahlquist : If possible, we'd want to also order the DVD, too. I think the VOD should be ok though, unless there is purchasing wierdness (e.g. someone decides that the video must undergo accessibility review or the purchase terms must undergo legal review, or etc.).<br />
15:45:45 - Mark Dahlquist : So I will go ahead and put in a rush order for this.<br />

15:46:24 - Patron : That would be amazing, if it's possible!

If you need more guidance I would reach out to the Howe Writing Center here: <a href=""https://miamioh.edu/hcwe/hwc/"" target=""_blank"">https://miamioh.edu/hcwe/hwc/</a> or to Megan Jaskowiak, our Health Sciences/Psychology/Sociology Librarian who is more familiar with this type of writing at jaskowma@miamioh.edu

20:01:40 - Zachary Grisham : What is your question?
20:03:46 - Patron : I am typing up a paper for class, and I am worried what I am writing is too close to what another paper wrote. All three sources are from a fourth article. The line in the fourth article is ""Those results are in line with studies in chronic schizophrenia which have constantly shown that increased slow wave activity is correlated with negative symptoms (Gattaz et al., 1992; Guenther et al., 1988; Harris et al., 1999).""
20:04:01 - Patron : My paper is ""Other studies used EEG to look at schizophrenia specifically (Gattaz et al. 1992; Guenther et al., 1988; Harris et al., 1999).""
20:04:26 - Patron : I think I am concerned because it uses all three the same sources listed in the same (alphabetical) order, since I got them all from the same paper
20:04:36 - Zachary Grisham : If you are citing it that is not plagiarism.
20:05:02 - Zachary Grisham : The idea behind plagiarism is using someone elses work and representing it as your own.
20:05:15 - Zachary Grisham : If you are citing it then you are letting everyone know it is not your work.
20:05:31 - Zachary Grisham : Are you citing the paper you got the quote from?
20:06:06 - Patron : I can!
20:06:22 - Zachary Grisham : If you think it is too close to another paper, I would just cite the paper. 
20:06:49 - Zachary Grisham : Then you won't be taking their work as your own, but citing their idea!
20:07:38 - Patron : Would I need to cite the orignial paper every time I cite one of the other three articles? I would be drawing my own conclusions from them
20:07:56 - Zachary Grisham : Nope, you only cite a paper if you took an idea from them. 
20:08:15 - Zachary Grisham : If you took conclusions from the other papers you would just need to cite them.

09:20:49 - Kristen Adams : Tell me more about which sources you are using
09:20:49 - Patron : Good morning!
09:21:23 - Patron : Sure! The first one is here- <a href=""https://www.concordiapsychjournals.ca/cjap/blog/method-or-madness/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.concordiapsychjournals.ca/cjap/blog/method-or-madness/</a>. I did not know if this was considered a website, journal, or blog.
09:21:26 - Patron : I am using APA
09:22:28 - Kristen Adams : I'd call this one a website, or a web article. It's not a journal article for sure, and I'm not sure I'd call it a blog.
09:23:29 - Patron : Okay, cool! Would the title for it have "":"" between the ""madness"" and the ""exploring""
09:23:29 - Kristen Adams : let me get the APA guide and see what the other options are...
09:24:28 - Kristen Adams : actually, I'm looking at it still and in the url it says blog, and also up at the very top - so I'd go with blog
09:24:46 - Patron : Does that change the citaiton?
09:25:08 - Kristen Adams : yes
09:25:30 - Kristen Adams : If you give me a minute I can scan in that page of the APA guide that has details on how to do the citation for a blog
09:25:51 - Kristen Adams : was there another source you wanted to clarify?
09:27:31 - Patron : A couple, yes. This is for a class outside of my major, and has different researching methods than I am used to. Usually, I am only allowed to use journal articles, which makes the process easier!
09:28:03 - Kristen Adams : Attached a file: <a href=""https://libanswers.lib.miamioh.edu/chat/session/chat-c768c4b26fdc4f081e95b1d245d77331d0ead6fc2f4bb8d4445a4d3f27e7ee26/upload/b0f24b49-7cb0-11ee-ba94-0a92197fae5f?instId=1286&amp;preview=1"" class=""s-la-cfile"" data-preview=""modal"" target=""_blank"">https://libanswers.lib.miamioh.edu/chat/session/chat-c768c4b26fdc4f081e95b1d245d77331d0ead6fc2f4bb8d4445a4d3f27e7ee26/upload/b0f24b49-7cb0-11ee-ba94-0a92197fae5f?instId=1286&amp;preview=1</a>
09:28:21 - Kristen Adams : ok, no worries - it is easier when all the sources are the same type.  :)
09:28:29 - Kristen Adams : here's the page on blog posts
09:28:35 - Kristen Adams : what other sources do you have?
09:29:21 - Patron : For this same one, would there be a colon between ""madness"" and ""exploring""?
09:31:54 - Kristen Adams : They have a ? between them in the title, so I'd leave it that way
09:32:17 - Patron : Does this look right? Samithamby, A. (2022, October 1). Method or madness? Exploring the psychological effects of method acting.

09:33:06 - Kristen Adams : yes, but the source title 

Concordia’s Journal of Accessible Psychology, should be in italics
09:34:03 - Patron : Perfect. My next one is <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/book/45800/chapter-abstract/400642748?redirectedFrom=fulltext"" target=""_blank"">https://academic.oup.com/book/45800/chapter-abstract/400642748?redirectedFrom=fulltext</a>. Is this considered a book or an article?

09:35:00 - Kristen Adams : looks like a book chapter
09:35:17 - Kristen Adams : let me look at the apa guide and see what formatting should be
09:38:21 - Kristen Adams : italics again for the title of the book(

Theater &amp; Human Flourishing

). but yes everything else looks good
09:38:49 - Patron : Okay! Next one is <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361379066_The_Importance_of_Safely_De-roling"" target=""_blank"">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361379066_The_Importance_of_Safely_De-roling</a>
09:39:39 - Patron : I am not sure if this counts as a website, as it looks like the orginial essay was taken from someplace else
09:41:25 - Kristen Adams : I think is from a journal
09:42:11 - Kristen Adams : I looked it up in Google Scholar and it says Methods: A Journal of Acting Pedagogy, and in hte PDF is says Vol. 2, so that clued me in that it wasn't just a book
09:42:22 - Kristen Adams : here's the journal page -https://press.pace.edu/methods/#:~:text=Methods%3A%20A%20Journal%20of%20Acting%20Pedagogy%2C%20is%20a%20peer%20reviewed,techniques%20and%20constructing%20new%20ones.
09:43:09 - Kristen Adams : and this looks right they seem to do a volume each year and vol 3 was 2017, the older ones are grouped below on that page
09:43:15 - Kristen Adams : so a journal, yes
09:45:52 - Patron : Okay! Would the date be 2016 then?
09:46:08 - Kristen Adams : yes
09:46:21 - Patron : Should I include the website url?
09:48:58 - Kristen Adams : I wouldn't, it's researchgate, and that site is not 100% legal. Authors can post their works there, and even though they are the authors, they don't always have rights to share their work. Often times when you write something and publish it, then you give rights to the publisher, and the publishers are not sometimes ok with sharing things for free. 
09:49:16 - Patron : Oh, ok. I won't use it then
09:49:48 - Kristen Adams : sounds good
09:49:55 - Kristen Adams : was there another source?
09:50:33 - Patron : Yes, one more. <a href=""https://indianmentalhealth.com/pdf/2018/vol5-issue1/Mental-Health-of-Actors.pdf"" target=""_blank"">https://indianmentalhealth.com/pdf/2018/vol5-issue1/Mental-Health-of-Actors.pdf</a>
09:50:40 - Kristen Adams : ok, lets look
09:50:53 - Patron : This is a pdf- is that also something that I shouldn't use? I found it on google scholar
09:52:24 - Kristen Adams : if you look at the url, this one is indianmentalhealth.com and that is the official journal page, so this one is ok to inlcude the url
09:52:50 - Kristen Adams : it looks like a journal article to me
09:53:15 - Patron : Okay, good! I think the doi came from Research gate though. I hadn't realized that wasn't a good website
09:56:04 - Kristen Adams : no worries, often people don't know about research gate, it seems very convenient as it comes up often and has articles for free, but it's complicated legally. Not always, but very often author's give away their rights when they publish. So it seems weird you can't share your own papers, but that's the situation. 
09:56:40 - Patron : Well, I think that is all the questions I have. Thank you so much for your help!!
09:56:46 - Kristen Adams : this last one though is from the publisher itself - the Mental Health of Actors
09:56:51 - Kristen Adams : glad to help
09:56:59 - Kristen Adams : enjoy the rest of the day

Do your sources need to be peer-reviewed or can you use other types of articles, etc.? Also, do you recall which library database you've used so far?
19:10:51 - Patron : My professor stated that we need 10 sources which may be either peer-reviewed articles, books, or book chapters from academic books. I've been using the OneSearch to help me find articles
19:14:36 - Barry Zaslow : Good to know about the options here. One specific database that should help is called Business Source Complete under Databases A-Z (a round button on the library home page). The search boxes can be combined with ""and"" so if you put ""influencers"" and ""consumer behavior"" and search TX text you may get some useful ones. I suggest limiting to the last few years and you can also see on the sides whether you want to limit to books or articles. Does this sound useful?
19:15:25 - Barry Zaslow : I did a sample search for the past 10 years and still got *a lot* of matches so maybe even just the last 3-5 years would be better.
19:16:02 - Patron : how do i search TX text
19:17:22 - Barry Zaslow : Once you are in Business Source Complete there should be drop down menus next to the search boxes and I think the TX all text is the default (or you can use the menu to scroll down if it's not showing)

There are a few ways to do this. The easiest way to see if a journal is peer-reviewed is to select the ""peer-reviewed"" box in the ""Articles and More"" search from the library home page.<br />
16:40:29 - Mark Dahlquist : You can also google the journal and review its policies or check a periodical guide such as Ulrich's.<br />
16:42:24 - Patron : I had clicked limit to peer review journals but once I click on the article, it doesnt say peer reviewed, does this mean it is not peer reviewed even though it is limited to peer reviewed journals?
16:44:03 - Mark Dahlquist : This does not necessarily mean that the article isn't peer-reviewed. However, there are cases where peer-reviewed journals will publish some content (such as book reviews) that have not gone through the peer-review process.<br />
16:44:58 - Mark Dahlquist : So, if the article seems to be a book review or a short letter to the editor, rather than a research article, it might not be peer-reviewed.<br />
16:45:32 - Patron : Okay thank you! So peer review is basically just any research article?
16:45:42 - Patron : Or most research articles
16:47:17 - Mark Dahlquist : In general, peer-review refers to the practice of when a journal will send an article out to be anonymously reviewed by 3-5 other published experts in the field prior to accepting the article for publication.<br />
16:48:10 - Mark Dahlquist : So, the concept can be a little vague (there are some journals that practice ""open"" or non-anonymous peer review, for example), but that is the general idea/<br />
16:48:11 - Mark Dahlquist : .
16:48:25 - Patron : Okay, thank you for the hlep!

It may also depend how much time you have; a book is, of course, going to take more time to read than an article. You'll probably also need to rely on popular sources (for example, news articles) if you're writing about a current event.

15:23:15 - Patron : thank you!!
15:23:28 - Stefanie Hilles : Not lately! I live in Hamilton now :)
15:23:39 - Patron : well I teach online on Sundays, it's free!

15:24:07 - Patron : I will email you later
15:24:27 - Stefanie Hilles : Cool! Thank you!! In the mean time, let me see what I can find here

15:29:02 - Patron : okay, I told my student she could get off the call and I'd email her. Let me take a look
15:29:41 - Stefanie Hilles : Of course! I'm going to keep looking, so if these don't look like what you want, let me know!
15:29:46 - Patron : I'm not seeing strategies for a speech therapist
15:30:16 - Patron : I thought this would be easy so searched with the student and couldn't find too much directly toward speech therapy
15:31:28 - Stefanie Hilles : I guess I'm not sure what you mean by strategies then?
15:32:36 - Patron : For example, the speech therapist should use repetition when working with the child, they should use visuals, they should make sure they use wait time, etc.
15:32:50 - Patron : How should a speech therapist work with children with intellectual disabilities?
15:33:22 - Stefanie Hilles : Ok. I can try to go broader?
15:33:56 - Patron : or more specific.... these are about speech but not about how a speech therapist should do their job
15:36:55 - Patron : and now my student is off the call... it's one hour intermediate ballet for adults, 4:30 - 5:30 every Sunday. I can put you on the Google calendar if you're interested or can give you just the link to check out and see if you want to do it!
15:37:15 - Stefanie Hilles : The link would be great!
15:37:38 - Stefanie Hilles : And I am still looking for you! I must not have the right keywords because I keep getting the same articles
15:38:08 - Patron : okay me too!! I am usually great at helping students in real time and it helps them with their searching skills, but this one I came up pretty empty
15:38:12 - Patron : meet.google.com/buw-rqup-sev
15:38:34 - Stefanie Hilles : Well, it's not just you!! I am also failing at this one!
15:39:12 - Patron : So strange!!
15:39:22 - Stefanie Hilles : And also frustrating!!
15:39:36 - Stefanie Hilles : I hate not being able to find stuff!!
15:40:04 - Patron : I usually use Education Research Complete so was trying to find the equivalent for Speech Pathology. I looked at the subject guide but the medical stuff was way too medical
15:40:46 - Stefanie Hilles : Yeah. I went with articles and more to try to pull in everything but am still not having much success
15:41:09 - Patron : I can tell her to go with what we have already or she's allowed to use some non-refereed sources
15:41:32 - Patron : Let's do that... in the meantime let me know if you're interested in ballet, love to have you!
15:41:42 - Stefanie Hilles : And I agree with you - this should be an easy one!
15:42:09 - Stefanie Hilles : I would love to come!! My mom is in town this weekend but I doubt she will stay that late on Sunday
15:43:46 - Patron : It's pretty much every Sunday, love to have you. I'll get back with this student, talk later!
15:44:05 - Stefanie Hilles : Ok!! So sorry I can't seem to find anything!!
15:44:30 - Stefanie Hilles : I am not willing to let this go, lol. I am going to keep digging for a couple more minutes and I will email you if I manage anything
15:47:22 - Patron : okay, I get it!!
15:48:09 - Stefanie Hilles : Wish me luck, lol. I will email you if I find anything. 
15:50:39 - Patron : Thank you!!

Can you tell me more about what you are seeking? Many of the libraries' resources are free for students and faculty because we cover the costs in our budget.
10:30:05 - Patron : I am looking for a scholarly source for an assignment I am doing in English class. My topic is drug abuse
10:30:41 - Barry Zaslow : That's a very broad topic. Do you have any ideas how you might want to narrow it down?
10:31:27 - Patron : Anything about how to prevent drug abuse, the consequences of drug abuses, causes of drug abuse, and or teenage substance abuse
10:34:53 - Barry Zaslow : OK. Our basic database is called Academic Search Complete which you can find if you choose the Databases A-Z button on the library home page <a href=""http://www.lib.miamioh.edu"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lib.miamioh.edu</a>. Once you have located this (either by scrolling down in the ""A"" section or putting its name in the left hand search box), you should be able to make searches using keywords like you typed in for me. There is a checkbox on the right column called ""peer reviewed"" which should get you to scholarly sources. You can also limit by years (perhaps the last five) and maybe in the search include a state like Ohio or Kentucky because you might get overwhelmed with matches. 
10:36:22 - Patron : thank you so much
10:36:46 - Barry Zaslow : You're welcome. If you need more help later there are people here till 9pm.

You can put ""immigration"" ""economy"" and ""United States"" in the search boxes and use the ""TX all text"" as your choice in the drop-down menu at the right.

11:37:17 - Patron : Okay, thank you.
11:40:15 - Barry Zaslow : Yes, the Assyrians subject heading doesn't give much help. I did find this one bibliography that might provide some sources although it's a bit dated: DS 73.9 .K36 1999 on King 2nd floor. Kamoo, Ray. <i>Ancient and modern Chaldean history</i>. This also uses Babylonia as a subject which at least in our catalog produces a lot more options. Do you think these will help you?
11:41:51 - Patron : I am not sure, but I thank you for your assistance. I will do some more term searching and see what comes up. I will have to play with it a bit.
11:42:31 - Barry Zaslow : Mesopotamia as a subject did not give me anything but as a keyword it had quite a bit.

11:56:40 - Zachary Grisham : Depends on what type of history you are looking for. It is likely this type of information would be in the archives, but I would be surprised if we had nothing in our collections on this as well. 
11:57:52 - Zachary Grisham : For example, here is a Miami university web page that includes the history of the school.

12:00:06 - Patron : Are the archives still apart of King? I am doing a project in class about historical Miami buildings so I am hoping to get some info on some of the older buildings on campus and their history (when they were built, any events of interest related to the buildings, etc.) Hopefully not too in depth as I don't have a lot of time for the project.
12:00:46 - Zachary Grisham : Yep! The archives are a wonderful part of King. They are on the third floor right down the hall from the makerspace. 
12:00:58 - Zachary Grisham : However, for more topical information.

13:27:56 - Patron : Also is there any chance you are visiting another class my ITL 221 meets on Tuesday and Thursdays. And thank you I will take a look at it!
13:28:08 - Katie Gibson : Ah, that's possible.
13:28:15 - Katie Gibson : Is your professor Dr. Zundel?
13:28:25 - Patron : Yes
13:28:28 - Katie Gibson : It's Tuesday... I've got the day wrong
13:28:30 - Katie Gibson : my apologies
13:28:38 - Patron : No worries!
13:28:49 - Katie Gibson : So yes, Historical Abstracts is a good place to start
13:28:58 - Katie Gibson : that bridge is in Florence?
13:29:08 - Patron : ys
13:29:11 - Patron : Yes
13:29:16 - Katie Gibson : ok
13:29:42 - Katie Gibson : hm, historical abstracts didn't have much on the bridge specifically
13:29:58 - Katie Gibson : but you can maybe find things on the history of Florence more generally
13:30:42 - Patron : Ok, sounds good!
13:31:03 - Katie Gibson : Using the Articles and More tab on the main catalog search, I found some things: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;bquery=ponte+vecchio&amp;cli0=FT1&amp;clv0=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;bquery=ponte+vecchio&amp;cli0=FT1&amp;clv0=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site</a>
13:31:48 - Katie Gibson : and on that page, you can limit the results to only those in English using the narrowers on the left
13:31:59 - Katie Gibson : because quite a few are not
13:32:03 - Patron : Awesome thanks!
13:32:12 - Katie Gibson : you're welcome

A couple of days ago, I asked if there was such thing as a community library card, and was told no. But today, I requested a book online, and the screen that comes up gives you 2 choices: enter your user/passs as fac or staff, OR as ""Friends of the Libraries, Community Borrowers, or workshop participants."" And they ask you to enter a barcode. Does this mean there IS a community library card?","","11","","10:28:30 - Barry Zaslow : Hi Amy. I saw your previous chat and wondered myself if this had changed. There used to be a community card for ""affiliated patrons"" that cost $25 per year. See if this page helps: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/c.php?g=1009317&amp;p=7311853&amp;preview=e205e79352d5cff3fab0931d70b90e67"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/c.php?g=1009317&amp;p=7311853&amp;preview=e205e79352d5cff3fab0931d70b90e67</a>
10:30:08 - Barry Zaslow : If not, I would suggest contacting Rob Withers who is our Access Services Librarian at witherre@miamioh.edu or Kris Abney our Circulation Manager at abneykl@miamioh.ed as they should know the absolute latest info. Sorry about all the confusion!
10:33:23 - Patron : Right! I don't see at this link where it says the card costs $25 tho. But either there is a community library card, or the library webpage is wrong! Thank you!
10:34:33 - Barry Zaslow : Definitely sounds like it needs some personal intervention from someone ""in the know"" (and there are a lot of pages that unfortunately point to staff who left in 2016 or procedures that were changed but not updated, though that's likely endemic to many organizations)
10:36:10 - Barry Zaslow : I think the ""Friend of the Libraries"" was $25 through the Dean's Office. Perhaps Community Borrowers is different, but that page doesn't tell you how to get those privileges, which Kris or Rob should be able to tell you. Of course if you are near campus you can stop in King Library as there are staff members at the circulation desk anytime 7am-1am every day
10:36:46 - Barry Zaslow : You could even try calling 513-529-4141 to see if someone ""knows""
10:37:14 - Barry Zaslow : Too many options, I admit
10:39:42 - Patron : Haha I agree on page updates.But the ""request a book"" page is pretty key to a library! And this all started cause I sent a friend to the circ desk for a card and they told her no, so then I checked at this chat with someone, and THEY said no. I guess the community borrower cards aren't used very often! Anyway, thanks, Barry, for your help and giving me hope that the card exists. I'll contact Rob and Kris.
10:41:01 - Barry Zaslow : Oh, dear. Too bad about your friend. Sounds like a training issue if indeed the CB cards *are* still used and if not then definitely lots of text on pages to update.
10:41:36 - Patron : Agree! Thx so much -
10:42:11 - Barry Zaslow : You're welcome. Hope you can get some useful info, and I will also check when next at King about what really is going on.

10:18:11 - Patron : Hi Jaclyn, thank you for taking your time.
10:18:43 - Patron : ...taking the time.
10:20:13 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I'm going to see if I can find any information about Information Literacy - Core and Credo
10:20:30 - Patron : Thanks.
10:21:32 - Patron : It has been very hard to talk to them, and they haven't answered my questions through email. Its as if they don't know what I'm talking about.
10:22:46 - Jaclyn Spraetz : It looks like Information Literacy - Core may be a separate list of videos than what we typically use and it is done through their parent site Infobase
10:23:08 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I'm seeing more on this guide about it: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.umt.edu/infolit-core"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.umt.edu/infolit-core</a>
10:23:25 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Or maybe they are the same thing?
10:23:46 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I'm looking at the list of videos they have on the guide and it seems that they match up with some of the videos we have: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/credo/start"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/credo/start</a>
10:24:50 - Jaclyn Spraetz : It looks like we do have this, but I have not typically referred to them as Info Lit - Core so was confused at first! Sorry! 
10:25:03 - Patron : Oh, thank you Jaclyn. This helps.
10:26:14 - Patron : Good luck and have a nice day.
10:26:18 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I also googled ""Credo Instruct"" to see what comes up and there are a few guides out there with that name

10:26:43 - Patron : Thank you. That's what we use.

10:26:52 - Jaclyn Spraetz : You're welcome! 
10:26:58 - Patron : I'm wondering if they changed from I
10:27:24 - Patron : ..from Credo Instruct to Info lit - Core?
10:27:38 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Yes, that is what I'm thinking! That they have just changed names
10:28:24 - Patron : Okay. Thank you for your time, Jaclyn. You've been very helpful. Have a nice day.(Silas Marques)

10:23:43 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C36&amp;q=Universal+Postal+Union+AND+rates&amp;btnG="" target=""_blank"">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C36&amp;q=Universal+Postal+Union+AND+rates&amp;btnG=</a>
10:24:07 - Zachary Grisham : We can figure out if there are similar publications that are more recent then see if we can access their data. 
10:24:59 - Patron : thanks
10:25:18 - Zachary Grisham : As an example, here is a case study on the organization.
10:25:19 - Zachary Grisham : Governance and control in networks: a case study of the Universal Postal Union<br />


10:25:26 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/AAAJ-04-2014-1687/full/html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/AAAJ-04-2014-1687/full/html</a>
10:25:34 - Zachary Grisham : Let us see if we have access from our library.
10:32:09 - Zachary Grisham : Well that did not work. We can try statista and IPUMs but it is starting to look like you might need to reach out to the union for the rates. Have you reached out to ask if they would be willing to share them for research purposes? (Without a fee)
10:34:32 - Zachary Grisham : Well, it looks like even Statista is just using their free data.
10:36:09 - Zachary Grisham : Hey, actually they have a graph on different rates over time.
10:36:32 - Zachary Grisham : But it seems to be by a price index?

10:37:07 - Zachary Grisham : I see why your professor wants this data, just found this in the report.
10:37:56 - Zachary Grisham : Well, won't let me copy and paste but they claim to have the largest source of data for rates from all over the world.
10:39:11 - Zachary Grisham : Still look at that report, it is pretty in depth but after reading a bit about it I doubt you will find any free way to access that data that is not through them. 
10:40:47 - Zachary Grisham : You still there?
10:59:23 - Zachary Grisham : Well, I am about to close the chat since I have not heard from you in a bit. Let me know if the library can be of help in the future!

How can we help you today with citation formatting?

10:08:07 - Barry Zaslow : Which style are you using? APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.
10:08:10 - Patron : APA
10:13:29 - Barry Zaslow : OK. I would suggest using our Citation Resources APA style guide from the library home page <a href=""http://www.lib.miamioh.edu"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lib.miamioh.edu</a>. There is a button in the middle of the page to access this. The examples appear to show not capitalizing anything that isn't a proper name, although I'm not an expert in APA myself. Does this help?
10:13:37 - Patron : Yep!
10:14:04 - Patron : For this one, would the date to be used 2022? <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.23241"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.23241</a>
10:16:32 - Barry Zaslow : It looks to be 2022 if you are using the Journal with its paging. The original publication date in 2021 might have been a pre-print (although it's hard to tell from the doi)
10:17:54 - Patron : Okay! And then I had a general question. Sometimes, the journal provides a full date (such as January 1st, 2023), but even so I usually only put the year in the reference citation
10:18:06 - Patron : Should I include the full date?
10:19:28 - Barry Zaslow : The APA examples show for scholarly articles only the year but for popular ones a year followed by a month. If you are near the campuses we do have a print copy of the APA 7th ed. manual you can browse also--just ask at the main desks
10:19:57 - Patron : What do you mean by ""popular ones""
10:20:46 - Barry Zaslow : The examples used are Time magazine and National Geographic versus scholarly titles such as Psychology of Popular Media Culture
10:20:53 - Patron : Ah I see.
10:21:05 - Patron : That's all the questions I have. Thank you!

19:41:17 - Patron : Paper Summary/Presentation Instructions
You will need to find an empirical paper on Ameerican economic history that presents a table or tables of
regression results on the economic question of interest for the paper. A good place to start looking for papers is
the Journal of Economic History or the Explorations in Economic History. You can access these journals
electronically through King library. You will need to identify the paper by Friday October 27 at 5:00, and post
your unique id, the paper name, and a link to the paper to a google sheet to which you will be invited. Finding the
link should not take too much time and you should be able to find a free pdf version. Again, this step may require
using an electronic version of the journal. If you cannot find a link, please contact me. Each student must have a
unique paper. The claim to a paper will be determined by the time your entry is posted on the google sheet.
You should make a power point summarizing your article following the style of the Mankiw, Romer, Weil article
that will be presented in class. You should then write a one page “executive summary” of the article. For
resources on how to write an executive summary, please see the links here. Your executive summary should be no
more than 250 words (use Word Count in word to check this constraint). The presentation should be submitted as
a pdf file and the executive summary should be submitted as a word file on Canvas. The filenames should be
uniqueid-sum and uniqueid-pre, so mine would be davisgk-sum and davisgk-pre.
The paper should address the following questions:
1. What is the historical setting of the paper?
2. What is the economic question that this article attempts to answer?
3. What relationships do they expect to find in the data? Why do they believe these relationships exists?
4. What are the empirical “proxies” for the key theoretical variables? What is the data source for these
variables?
5. Write out the regression equation that is estimated.
6. What did the author(s) find? Were the signs on the estimated coefficients as expected and were they
statistically significant?
7. What was the answer to the economic question described in point 2 above?
8. What is the strongest reason to agree with the author's conclusions? What is the strongest reason to
disagree with the author's conclusions?
Your grade will be based on your success in
1. The clarity of your description of the economic question and relationships
2. The clarity and accuracy o

11:44:28 - Patron : Hi! If an article has one date, but then an ""updated date"" because there was a problem in the first one, which should I put? It was updated apparently because there was a error in the graphs, but not in the information (I don't think)

11:44:52 - Abigail Morgan : HM, interesting! Let me read over this, one minute.
11:46:46 - Abigail Morgan : In general, you should use the date of the actual document you are citing. Since this has a corrected citation though, that is what I would use
11:46:54 - Abigail Morgan : Yang, C., Shirayama, Y., Zhang, Jc. <i>et al.</i> Correction: <i>R</i>-ketamine: a rapid-onset and sustained antidepressant without psychotomimetic side effects. <i>Transl Psychiatry</i> <b>10</b>, 295 (2020). <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-00983-3"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-00983-3</a>

11:48:09 - Patron : And then, if I had a paper where they did a study that leads to ""Fact 1"", but also cited other studies that found the same thing, do I need to cite all of them to use ""Fact 1""?
11:49:54 - Abigail Morgan : I think in cases like that you would say something like...""Fact 1 is well-established by multiple studies. One by Smith and Jones for example....""
11:50:04 - Abigail Morgan : And then you don't need to cite all of the studies
11:50:08 - Abigail Morgan : If that makes sense
11:50:55 - Patron : So, if Smith and Jones did a study that found Fact 1, but also note that Miller and Sam found Fact 1 as well, I only need to cite Smith and Jones?
11:51:37 - Abigail Morgan : Yes, since you really only got the information from Smith and Jones and presumably didn't read the other articles
11:51:41 - Patron : Yeah.
11:52:40 - Patron : Okay, and then, does the library have in-person office hours where I can meet with a librarian to talk about questions about research? Some of them are hard to desribe over chat
11:53:21 - Abigail Morgan : Sort of...one of the librarians on chat during the semester is on-campus and you can always ask to meet with them if you are in the library
11:53:43 - Abigail Morgan : But you can also schedule an appointment with the subject librarians

I am doing research to decide which flavor of Pedialyte to provide in stores based on the psychology behind color and their appeal to children and adults. I found reasoning behind colors, with yellow providing energy and happiness, red giving love, health, and vigor, orange affordability, adventure, exploration, blue and white relaxation, and purple royalty. I think that yellow would work great with kids for the creativity and happiness but am struggling to figure out which other colors would appeal to them most. Red and blue always seemed like favorites but we have been urged to find specific data behind it. My options for the kid selection are white, orange, red, and purple. If i could find information that could argue why red, purple, or white would appeal to children that could be helpful. Currently, I am thinking that red works more with adults and the relaxation of white does so too.

Department: Reference
 User: Laura Birkenhauer

","44","","16:41:51 - Laura Birkenhauer : Hello, how can I help you?
16:42:24 - Patron : Hi! I think we were talking earlier. I had some questions about citing images in APA format
16:42:41 - Laura Birkenhauer : Yes! Can you tell me more about what you need help with?
16:42:56 - Laura Birkenhauer : If you have a specific question, or if you need the resources from earlier.
16:43:56 - Patron : Yeah! I had a couple of websites I found that I wanted to make sure were good to use. 1.
16:44:44 - Patron : Would <a href=""https://www.pexels.com/photo/blurred-portrait-of-shouting-person-17691608/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.pexels.com/photo/blurred-portrait-of-shouting-person-17691608/</a> be good to use? Is ""Blurred Portrait of Shouting Person"" the title?
16:45:30 - Laura Birkenhauer : When you say ""good to use"" what do you mean? I often use Pexels as a source for stock images, so for that purpose I'd definitely recommend it!
16:45:38 - Patron : Okay!
16:45:47 - Laura Birkenhauer : And, yes, I'll get the info on the citation and what we'd use for the description.
16:47:47 - Laura Birkenhauer : This particular image does not require a citation: ""

If the license associated with clip art or a stock image states “no attribution required,” then do not provide an APA Style reference, in-text citation, or copyright attribution.""
16:47:52 - Laura Birkenhauer : <a href=""https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples/clip-art-references"" target=""_blank"">https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples/clip-art-references</a>
16:48:20 - Patron : My professor said that I should have citation, though
16:48:44 - Laura Birkenhauer : Sure, I thought that may be the case. One moment.
16:50:16 - Laura Birkenhauer : Stoilov, S. (2023). <i>Blurred Portrait of Shouting Person</i> [Photograph]. Pexels, <a href=""https://www.pexels.com/photo/blurred-portrait-of-shouting-person-17691608/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.pexels.com/photo/blurred-portrait-of-shouting-person-17691608/</a>
16:50:30 - Laura Birkenhauer : I used the format found here: <a href=""https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/reference_list_audiovisual_media.html"" target=""_blank"">https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/reference_list_audiovisual_media.html</a>
16:50:33 - Patron : Okay, that looks like the one I made.
16:50:38 - Laura Birkenhauer : Great!
16:50:46 - Laura Birkenhauer : Sounds like you're on the right track!
16:50:50 - Patron : <a href=""https://www.stockvault.net/photo/253988/therapist-silhouette"" target=""_blank"">https://www.stockvault.net/photo/253988/therapist-silhouette</a>
16:51:14 - Patron : For ones like this one, it looks like the author's name is not capatilized. Should I not capatilize it as well?
16:51:29 - Laura Birkenhauer : Ah, good question. I'll consult the APA style manual for that.
16:51:29 - Patron : What should I do if the author's name is not a name but like a username?
16:58:25 - Laura Birkenhauer : OK, so you can use the username as the author's name, and you should ""retain the author's preferred capitalization (e.g., hooks, b., for bell hooks) in both the reference list and the in-text citation
16:59:12 - Laura Birkenhauer : Is there anything else I can assist with? My shift is ending, but I'd be happy to transfer you to another librarian who is taking over at 5 pm!
16:59:40 - Patron : Oh, my bad! Yes, would you please transfer me over. I have a couple more questions
16:59:49 - Laura Birkenhauer : Will do!
17:00:24 - Nate Floyd : haha go it
17:00:38 - Nate Floyd : Hello :) 
17:00:38 - Patron : hi!
17:01:02 - Nate Floyd : I'm going to read through the recent history and while I'm doing that let me know how I can help. 
17:02:20 - Nate Floyd : OK, how can I help
17:02:30 - Patron : Sure! I just had a couple more questions about the image citations. For example, when using things off of <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Career_Change_Jump_Cartoon.svg"" target=""_blank"">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Career_Change_Jump_Cartoon.svg</a>, would (for this example) title be ""Career Change Jump Cartoon""?
17:03:19 - Nate Floyd : Yes, I that looks correct to me. 
17:05:51 - Patron : Okay! And then, for citing these images, many of them say to use proper attribution. The article the library provided for me (https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples/clip-art-references) says to use a copyright attribution for an in-text citation.
17:06:33 - Patron : However, my professor says that in-text ciations are not needed for this presentation. Do I still need to add this in order to attribute properly, or is just including the reference enough?
17:07:56 - Nate Floyd : I would follow my professor's guidance only because they are the person who will be grading. If yo think your professor won't penalize you for including the in-text citation, then maybe include. But, I would follow my professor's guidance, then I would follow the article the library provided. That's how I would rank my priorities. 
17:08:01 - Nate Floyd : Does that make sense? 
17:09:27 - Nate Floyd : I think just a general comment is to remember that the purpose of the citation is to enable someone to track down whatever sources you used. So, we just try to conform to APA style, and be consistent the best we can, but as long as we are getting the main things correct I think we are OK. 
17:09:43 - Patron : I don't think they would penalize me necessarily, but I am a little confused as to where the ""CC"" information would come from
17:10:23 - Nate Floyd : I would cite with whatever information I have available and just try to be consistent with that. If you aren't sure which to use, and you don't have to include this detail per your professor's directives, I would just skip it. 
17:10:34 - Patron : Okay!
17:10:45 - Patron : That's all I have! Thank you for your help!
17:10:54 - Nate Floyd : Good luck w your work :) 
17:10:58 - Patron : Thanks!

17:18:19 - Patron : Is the format iilustration? What are the options?
17:19:09 - Nate Floyd : The options tied to the number of formats available. I would guess in this context it's an illustration.
17:20:05 - Patron : Would the title be ""Free 3D Illustration Of A Mental Health Conceptual Image By Quince Media 09""
17:20:30 - Nate Floyd : I think the title is whatever is printed next to the word ""File"" 
17:21:13 - Patron : Okay, great! Should I include the "".jpg"" part?
17:21:40 - Nate Floyd : I would not 
17:22:28 - Nate Floyd : Remember, it's not about getting it perfect always, it's about giving enough information so that someone can get back to the original source. 
17:22:36 - Patron : Makes sense.
17:23:19 - Patron : Okay, one more question- if they are avalible to use and download, am I able to just copy and paste them instead or do I need to download them in order to use them?
17:23:46 - Nate Floyd : There are no rules about such a thing. 
17:23:54 - Nate Floyd : You can do what works best for you. 
17:24:33 - Patron : Awesome! Again, thank you so much for helping

09:01:40 - Patron : Hi!
09:01:45 - Kristen Adams : What questions do you have?
09:01:55 - Kristen Adams : I have a copy of APA 7 with me, thankfully
09:02:08 - Patron : I am trying to cite images, and I am confused as to what to put for the ""format"" part of the citaiton.
09:02:24 - Patron : Like for these two <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Emotions_wheel.png"" target=""_blank"">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Emotions_wheel.png</a> and <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Emoticon_Face_Neutral_GE.png"" target=""_blank"">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Emoticon_Face_Neutral_GE.png</a>
09:03:23 - Kristen Adams : Ok, let me see, I'm on the right section now in the book for 'visual works'
09:04:20 - Kristen Adams : I can scan these pages in for you if you like
09:05:11 - Kristen Adams : however the 'format' options see to be: painting, clipart, lithograph, infographic, map, lecture notes
09:05:29 - Kristen Adams : for the emoticon, I'd suggest clipart
09:05:49 - Kristen Adams : the other one, maybe infographic?
09:05:58 - Kristen Adams : the others don't seem to fit it,
09:06:25 - Kristen Adams : photograph is another choice, but again the emotions wheel is not a photograph either
09:06:40 - Patron : Yeah. I'll do infographic
09:07:41 - Patron : So would it be [Clipart] or [Clip Art]
09:07:58 - Kristen Adams : in the book they have it as two words
09:08:03 - Patron : ok cool
09:08:06 - Patron : What do you think about this one? It is a stock photo technically, but it doesn't really look like a photo? Should I put photograph?
09:08:13 - Patron : <a href=""https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/emotional-intelligence-concept-businessman-2109476981"" target=""_blank"">https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/emotional-intelligence-concept-businessman-2109476981</a>
09:09:17 - Kristen Adams : I'd think stock photo
09:09:44 - Kristen Adams : and in the book they have ""clip art or stock photo"" as the same category
09:09:55 - Kristen Adams : and in the examples they call them 'clip art'
09:10:26 - Patron : Oh so for all the stock photos I should list them as clip art? Or as [stock photo]
09:11:04 - Kristen Adams : I think yes all the stock photos should be called clip art
09:11:50 - Kristen Adams : the heading for that type under 'visual works' is called 'clip at or stock image' but in none of the examples do they cite it as 'stock image' - it's just 'clip art'
09:12:42 - Patron : Ah okay.
09:13:55 - Patron : And then one more question- more general! If I were to write out a title in APA, you usually only capatlize the first word. Does that count for proper nouns, acroynms, or roman numerals?
09:14:55 - Kristen Adams : I would still capitalize proper nouns, acronyms and roman numerals
09:15:11 - Patron : Okay! What if they do not capatlize the first word?
09:15:40 - Kristen Adams : like a word that is meant to start in lowercase?
09:16:47 - Patron : Like the image title is lowercase
09:17:18 - Patron : Or they do not capitalize the proper noun
09:17:33 - Patron : <a href=""https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/portrait-young-man-isolated-on-black-110801942"" target=""_blank"">https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/portrait-young-man-isolated-on-black-110801942</a>
09:17:35 - Patron : Like this
09:18:15 - Kristen Adams : I think I see what you mean
09:18:34 - Kristen Adams : the '

portrait of a young man isolated on a black background holding a mirror showing two different sides"" seems like a description rather than the title
09:18:43 - Kristen Adams : you can capatlize the P
09:18:50 - Patron : Oh, okay. I've been using them as titles
09:19:07 - Kristen Adams : They have an example of this in the 'photo' section
09:19:22 - Kristen Adams : let me scan this for you - it's just two pages and can be in the same scan
09:19:28 - Kristen Adams : I'll be right back
09:19:34 - Kristen Adams : then you can see the examples

09:21:29 - Kristen Adams : Hopefully that works?
09:22:02 - Kristen Adams : it's under 101. photograph that has the examples of using a description rather than a title
09:22:19 - Kristen Adams : but I think it's applicable to the other visual works
09:22:51 - Patron : Okay!
09:23:09 - Patron : Sorry, one more question. What would you call this?

11:32:00 - Barry Zaslow : You may have to do some tweaking of search terms. There are also some relevant databases if you use this list: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/az/databases?s=8441"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/az/databases?s=8441</a> that includes health and nutrition.

09:26:15 - Kristen Adams : very long link, sorry
09:27:00 - Kristen Adams : I did a search for 'virtual reality' AND 'malnutrition' and also for 

'augmented reality' AND 'malnutrition'
09:27:06 - Kristen Adams : only had 6 results for each
09:27:26 - Kristen Adams : and that was leaving out anything about hospitals
09:28:12 - Kristen Adams : have you found any articles about this already?
09:28:55 - Patron : Not much honestly. I am working on a research project with taste perception and trying to find a way to incorporate it into hospitals with helping with malnutrition
09:29:41 - Patron : I was also looking for papers related to augmented or virtual reality helping with reducing prolonged hospitalization stays
09:30:43 - Kristen Adams : if you've found a few, or even one - we can look it up in Web of Science - and in there it tracks citations, so we can easily browse the bibliography to find other related papers, or see if any newer papers have cited that one
09:30:55 - Kristen Adams : that's another strategy to use when we can't find much
09:32:18 - Patron : I have found a paper that used augmented reality to help with people with binge eating disorder, and increase physical activity would those be ok to use?

08:52:42 - Patron : That one is a bit more interesting as it ties in architecture and I could maybe use it from a theoretical standpoint. Maybe this is a long shot but do you know of any architectural theorists that dislike the idea of technology or the systems of change and traditions?

10:44:35 - Jenny Presnell :  ok
10:45:03 - Patron : but the other ones i think look like it's from savitribai phule pune university which means the university is named after her i think
10:45:13 - Patron : is britannica not a good source? :(
10:45:28 - Jenny Presnell : no
10:45:43 - Patron : alrighty
10:46:02 - Patron : i just want a more biographical source
10:46:02 - Jenny Presnell : not for a research paper
10:46:07 - Jenny Presnell : let me try something else
10:46:18 - Patron : thanks!
10:47:02 - Jenny Presnell : what are your writing
10:47:04 - Jenny Presnell : generally
10:47:12 - Jenny Presnell : an encyclopedia isn't research
10:47:17 - Jenny Presnell : just factual information
10:47:26 - Jenny Presnell : which is not what you want for a paper
10:47:50 - Jenny Presnell : which is why Britannica, a good encyclopedia isn't a good source in that case
10:48:28 - Patron : i'm writing about the internal diversity of hinduism in the 19th-century. it's a case study analysis so i had to pick a specific example so i chose the phule couple. i think most sources have to be academic but the intended audience is high school students who want to learn more about marriage across cultures.

I suggest calling the main desk at 513-529-4141 to explain your needs and the staff there should be able to clarify what you can/cannot do. There is metered parking near King Library and in some garages that are a few block walk. This is finals week so the campus will soon be much quieter as the week goes on. Does this help?

17:44:43 - Andy Revelle : Let me see if we have other materials on this
17:46:07 - Patron : I cited it! I am just worried because I am citing a definition, and they defintion I am citing is different from the way I know the definition to be.
17:46:29 - Patron : They said this ""The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) defines dissociation as a break or interruption in the ordinary integration of behavior, body representation, consciousness, emotion, identity, memory, motor control, or perception.""
17:47:10 - Patron : Which is kind of what I think of for dissociation, but not really. I am worried that the way that I paraphrased it is leading into more of the definiton that I know then the definition I am citing.
17:47:29 - Patron : Here's what I said- They say that “dissociation” is when a pause happens between different parts of the mind or body working together
17:48:15 - Andy Revelle : That doesn't seem like a problem to me at all, so long as you cite everything.
17:48:42 - Patron : I just worry that I am too close to ""my"" defintion, which might require a different citation
17:48:56 - Andy Revelle : But if you are in doubt, just use a direct quote for their citation. 
17:49:02 - Andy Revelle : That's the safest thing to do
17:49:11 - Patron : Okay!
17:49:37 - Andy Revelle : Do you need help with anything else?
17:50:33 - Patron : My teacher says to use a ""in cited"" in text citation for this- Is this what that would look like? They say that “dissociation” is a break or interruption in the ordinary integration of behavior, body representation, consciousness, emotion, identity, memory, motor control, or perception” (American Psychiatric Association, 2013, as cited in Burgoyne et al., 1999, p. 2).

17:55:19 - Andy Revelle : My inclination is no page numbers for an online article, but since you can create that PDF you might use that just to be safe. But it technically doesn't have them

It's called ""two-by-ten"" and is a simple behavior management strategy. I'm having difficulty finding original research on this, particularly what's currently available to me through MU libraries. It's also hard to find because of the way you search something with a number in its name. It might be one for the subject librarian but thought I'd check with you. :)","","30","","09:07:34 - Patron : Hi! Nice little challenge for your morning :)
09:08:05 - Patron : I literature REVIEW would be perfect.
09:08:12 - Patron : I meant ""A"" literature review, hehe
09:09:37 - Barry Zaslow : Hi Leah. Let me see what I can find and if I get stuck will refer you to a subject specialist. I assume you normally work with Jaclyn Spraetz for EdPsych?
09:09:50 - Patron : yes I do, we are very tight, hehe :)
09:10:05 - Patron : I'm finding some info on this but it seems to be for practitioners, and I really need the original research.
09:10:20 - Patron : I want to use it in my own research.
09:10:29 - Barry Zaslow : OK. I will give it a go now.
09:12:07 - Patron : Thanks Barry!
09:12:21 - Patron : Take your time, I'm just here working on it myself.
09:13:08 - Patron : Apparently it was originally termed ""two minute intervention""
09:14:07 - Barry Zaslow : Good to know. I started with PsycInfo and used ""2 by 10"" but of course that produced a lot of articles about the age range two-ten. Sorting through some ideas.
09:15:25 - Patron : yes, I found you really have to put this in quotes ""two-by-ten""
09:15:39 - Patron : but the research articles I found weren't available, I asked for one via ILL
09:15:55 - Patron : I usually use Education Research Complete, so glad you're using that database
09:16:31 - Barry Zaslow : I was about to try ERC also. The ""two minute intervention"" didn't have any matches at all in PsycInfo so far
09:20:01 - Patron : okay, I did find some with Google Scholar and with Education Research Complete.
09:20:21 - Patron : I'm not very efficient with Google Scholar though to be transparent.
09:22:10 - Barry Zaslow : III
09:24:31 - Barry Zaslow : Sorry--I'm also in Google Scholar and found this book citation which refers to The 2×10 strategy, introduced by researcher Raymond Wlodkowski (1983). The book title appears to be Accelerating learning for all, pre K-8 which we have as an e-book in our collection since July. Perhaps you already knew about this but if not it sounds promising.
09:25:26 - Barry Zaslow : Maybe they would have some bibliographic citations to research about this strategy if it's been around for 40 years?
09:28:01 - Patron : okay great, I saw that but mostly they referred to some old video series.
09:28:18 - Patron : Are you suggesting to look up citations on Google Scholar?
09:28:31 - Patron : For some reason I never do that, I tend to look for the newer stuff and go backwards
09:28:52 - Barry Zaslow : I did a Google Scholar search combining Wlodkowski and two-minute intervention and there might be some things there. No, I just meant if you read parts of the book they may cite some useful things within the book
09:29:20 - Barry Zaslow : like in chapter notes or a bibliography at the end
09:29:58 - Patron : You mean the original study?
09:30:01 - Barry Zaslow : Especially since it's a brand new 2023 title (?)
09:30:36 - Patron : okay, looking up book
09:31:14 - Barry Zaslow : Probably the original study will show up somewhere within it but maybe also succeeding topical articles, etc. I'm not sure. This is a bit beyond my area of familiarity given that I do mostly performing arts stuff...

09:51:33 - Abigail Morgan : Wild, that record is not showing up when I searched the catalog at all
09:51:57 - Patron : it happens all the time. About 75% of searches I do, confirmed by a colleague who experiences the same thing. There is soemthig wrong with the Miami catalogue
09:52:05 - Patron : if 'm working at night, I'm stuck because it's after hours
09:52:11 - Abigail Morgan : Based on what I'm seeing in Project Muse, we don't actually own this ebook
09:52:13 - Patron : happens more often now than not
09:52:28 - Patron : it's in our catalogue!
09:53:03 - Patron : usually it's the other way around. something doesn't show in the catalouge but it'sactally there, which you see when you go to order it from ILL and you can't because Miami has it and it's not showing in the ctalogue.
09:53:07 - Patron : sorry for all the typos
09:53:13 - Abigail Morgan : No problem
09:53:22 - Patron : lots of glitches with the catalogue now. Used to work fine, not anymore
09:53:29 - Patron : so I can't access this book?
09:53:35 - Abigail Morgan : The Classic Catalog (which is definitely hard to find on the library's homepage) is more updated <a href=""https://holmes.lib.miamioh.edu/screens/fullmenu.html"" target=""_blank"">https://holmes.lib.miamioh.edu/screens/fullmenu.html</a>
09:53:35 - Patron : it's just wrong?
09:53:40 - Abigail Morgan : It doesn't have a record for this
09:54:03 - Patron : Half the tiem, I can't access stuff, esepcially Cambrdige ebooks
09:54:06 - Patron : Cambridge Core.
09:54:21 - Patron : so it's open access. How can I get access to it?
09:55:20 - Abigail Morgan : A lot of times, we buy ebook packages or get them through OhioLINK and the records can be weird in our system
09:55:53 - Patron : it's lots of things, not just this kind of attempt to access. I do tons of online research and there is something going wrong with the Miami catalogue. I've discussed it with colleagues
09:56:21 - Patron : so how do I access an open access book that you need institutional access to access?
09:57:01 - Abigail Morgan : If you can document this or other problems you are having with the catalog and send it to eresources@miamioh.edu they might be able to figure out what is going on
09:57:36 - Patron : I already have. I write in with these queries all the time. but I don't really have time to explain the whole process unless I'm on a particular title request with you/a librarian at the moment. They always say tey will make a note
09:57:46 - Abigail Morgan : I don't think this book is open access since it is asking me to buy it when I'm logged into Project Muse. I can see if I can find any record of a purchase in our system
09:57:51 - Patron : I'd be doing this a few times a day
09:57:53 - Patron : OK, thanks
09:58:20 - Patron : besides, I don't know what's going on. I just know the catalogue is pretty messed up
09:59:17 - Abigail Morgan : Unfortunately, the librarians who staff chat are not the ones who have access to the behind the scenes workings of the catalog. If you can send me a permalink (might be under the Share button on the record screen) I will pass on what I can
09:59:20 - Patron : it's like I describe: you attempt to link to a source and Miami has access but yo udon't--you get sent to the institutional link where nothing is avaialble. The other type of problem is many, many titles missing from the Miami catalogue that are actually there
09:59:40 - Abigail Morgan : So you are starting a search from the library's homepage and this happens?
09:59:44 - Patron : You go to ILL to order a title and Miami shows as a holder but the title is not in the catalogue
09:59:54 - Patron : mostly, yes, and it happens to other people
10:00:18 - Patron : I don't know where people are when they're accessing King. Never used to be a problem. I live inMA mostly for over 10 years. Recent problems, not before
10:00:58 - Patron : is this the permalink: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip&amp;db=edsoai&amp;AN=edsoai.on1379004735&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;profile=eds-cat-jy"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip&amp;db=edsoai&amp;AN=edsoai.on1379004735&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;profile=eds-cat-jy</a>
10:01:02 - Abigail Morgan : This particular book has no order record in our system, so I'm not sure why it is showing up for you like we own it
10:01:18 - Patron : OK. but the reverse happens even more frequently
10:01:23 - Abigail Morgan : yes it is, thank you!
10:01:34 - Patron : how will I know what happens with this? I have to get offline
10:02:43 - Abigail Morgan : I think part of the problem is that this is from OneSearch, which searches all of our databases and catalog together and I think it does have a lot of errors
10:03:05 - Abigail Morgan : sorry if my response is delayed they are replacing a window down the hall from my office and it is incredibly loud
10:03:24 - Patron : OK, I need to get offline. How will I know what is happening with this request?
10:03:26 - Abigail Morgan : For book research, you can use the Books and More tab, and that should be more accurate
10:04:33 - Abigail Morgan : I can cc you on the email I send to our eresources staff
10:04:41 - Patron : thank you!
10:05:34 - Abigail Morgan : Using the Books and More tab or the classic catalog will show you the books we actually own, so that is one way to make sure the reverse doesn't happen in the future
10:05:51 - Patron : will try that more often, thanks
10:06:00 - Abigail Morgan : you're welcome!
