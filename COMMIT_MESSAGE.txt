Vector Search Optimization: Complete RAG system overhaul

Major improvements to the RAG knowledge base for better semantic search:

🎯 Core Changes:
- Simplified Weaviate schema from 12 fields to 4 (question, answer, keywords, topic)
- AI-powered generalization using o4-mini for broader question applicability
- Merged 64 duplicate questions (1,632 → 1,568 optimized items)
- Replaced transcript_rag_agent.py with optimized version

📁 New Files:
Scripts:
- scripts/optimize_for_vector_search.py - AI-powered Q&A generalization
- scripts/ingest_transcripts_optimized.py - New ingestion with simplified schema
- scripts/process_new_year_data.py - Automated annual data processing
- scripts/advanced_filter.py - AI-assisted quality filtering
