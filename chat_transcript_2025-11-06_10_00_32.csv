11:11:51 - Barry Zaslow : There are at least two ways to get to it, using Databases A-Z from the library home page by choosing the little # at the end of the alphabet (there are only two in that section) or going to the Books &amp; More section of the home page and putting in ""C19, then use the title option before searching and it's the only match (you can also use keyword where it's the first of a series of matches.

11:46:59 - Barry Zaslow : It's actually in a pool of titles from the ProQuest database and it was just added this past Monday so it did not show up in the Books &amp; More (public catalog from the library home page) yet but I'm using a back-end search
11:48:02 - Barry Zaslow : Would you still like me to ask someone in King Circulation about your challenges getting the print copy from OhioLINK? I can't resolve that myself but I can forward that along. Sometimes it has to do with emeritus status but that's not always the reason.
11:52:21 - Barry Zaslow : I think I see what is going on at OhioLINK. The only (print) copy is at Bowling Green but it's not ready for check out yet as it says ""in process"" which could mean it's still on order or being cataloged, so I don't think there is any problem with your Miami information.

09:12:52 - Katie Gibson : I'm happy to help you out with that.
09:13:05 - Katie Gibson : Is there any particular topic you are searching in ERIC for?
09:13:44 - Patron : I am creating an annotated bibliography on how exclusionary discipline contributes to student apathy
09:13:59 - Katie Gibson : Oh, that sounds interesting!
09:14:07 - Katie Gibson : Do you know how to get to ERIC?
09:14:26 - Katie Gibson : from the Library's website, go to Databases A-Z, and it will be listed under E
09:14:41 - Patron : yes, but when I typed in my key terms it did not return any results. I figured I did something wrong.
09:15:13 - Katie Gibson : Try splitting it up and put one main idea in each of the search boxes
09:15:34 - Katie Gibson : If you put them all in one box, it'll look for that phrase instead of those ideas separately
09:15:51 - Katie Gibson : so try exclusionary discipline in one and student apathy in the next
09:16:22 - Patron : It is still returning no results, do I need to select a particular field?
09:16:44 - Katie Gibson : Hmmm, I suspect that we might need to change that second term to get at that second idea
09:16:54 - Katie Gibson : because there's lots about exclusionary discipline
09:17:13 - Katie Gibson : so maybe if we look at something like drawbacks or negatives or impacts or something like that
09:17:23 - Katie Gibson : I'll play around with terms and see if I can come up with something
09:18:02 - Katie Gibson : Ok, so I started typing in cons in the search box and it auto completed with ""cons or negatives or bad or disadvantages or problems""
09:18:16 - Patron : I tried student engagement and that returned more results so I will keep trying other terms
09:18:27 - Katie Gibson : Oh, that's a great idea
09:18:45 - Katie Gibson : And once you find a good article, look at what other words they use and you can add them to the search too
09:19:01 - Katie Gibson : Sometimes it's a bit of an iterative process 
09:19:33 - Katie Gibson : If there is no full text of the article attached, click that yellow find it button, and it will tell you if the article is in another of our databases
09:19:42 - Katie Gibson : if it isn't, you'll get a link to request it for free

Varro, De Re Rustica
Cato, De Agricultura
Columella, De Re Rustica
Generally, they all use a Book.Chapter.Line identifier system. When I reference each, the practice is generally to cite them ""Bibically"" in text, even though I am using Chicago style. I was wondering, since I have a series of citations in only a few sentences, what information should I include in the Parentheses? 

This is the idea I have now, but I need more opinions. 
Varro argued for swift punishment of slaves by the overseer when established rules have been broken (De Re Rustica, 1.16-1.17). Cato (De Agricultura, 5.1) and Columella (De Re Rustica, 1.8.18) advocate for the punishment of unruly or lazy enslaved workers as well.","","7","","12:54:44 - Andy Revelle : That looks correct to me, but you may want to ask this to our History librarian who is much more familiar with Chicago Style than I am.

13:53:44 - Barry Zaslow : It looks like the 1975 issues are in JSTOR. Do you know how to get to that? If you go to Databases A-Z on the library home page then either scroll down to the ""J"" section or put JSTOR in the search box it should come up. Then you can browse by journal title and it sorts them by years
13:54:16 - Barry Zaslow : We also have the print copies at the Regional Depository, but that will take a few days to get here.
13:55:20 - Patron : Yes, no problem. I will go the JSTOR route. Thanks so much for your help. Hope you are well, Mary Janeyour he
13:55:47 - Barry Zaslow : You too.

OhioLINK books are three week loans for students with renewal possibilities if no one else has a hold on it. You should be able to renew it up to six times.

I don't see the option for this format now, while I've done this for many years","","17","","20:33:17 - Ginny Boehme : Let me take a look, I am not familiar with this
20:33:37 - Ginny Boehme : is there one in particular you are looking for?
20:34:22 - Patron : Today Barry Zaslow found a a score for me, which was the Cello Concerto by Elgar: M1017 .E44x op.85 1947
20:35:25 - Patron : Now, I am looking for a Piano Concerto by Mozart. More details: Piano Concerto in A Major, K. 414
20:35:46 - Patron : By W. A. Mozart
20:36:10 - Ginny Boehme : Ok let me see what I can find. In the catalog, there is a way to limit to music scores using the Material Type filter, but sometimes things go wonky
20:36:46 - Patron : That's exactly the point: I cannot find anymore that Material Type filter for music scores!!!
20:38:14 - Ginny Boehme : It is a bit buried when there are lots of results, or it disappears completely if we don't have what you're looking for. I think this might be the latter, I'm only seeing recordings of this piece, no scores in house
20:40:02 - Ginny Boehme : we might have a miniature score: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip&amp;db=cat00344a&amp;AN=mucat.b1133070&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip&amp;db=cat00344a&amp;AN=mucat.b1133070&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site</a>
20:40:10 - Patron : I don't think this is correct. I tried to find by myself the score of the Cello Concerto by Elgar and couldn't because the filter for music scores is not available. Even by going through all the 5+ pages of entries I could not find it. Yet, Barry Zaslow found it for me.
20:41:08 - Patron : Yes, you found it! That's exactly what I was looking for. How did you do it???
20:42:03 - Ginny Boehme : It's ""concerti"" in italian, not ""concerto"" which I tried at first. I searched ""mozart 414"" to try to cast a wide net, and it was the very last result
20:42:30 - Ginny Boehme : Music is challenging to search, Barry is a wizard
20:43:52 - Patron : I see...Now, in the case of Elgar's Cello Concerto, using concerti doesn't work. Yet, you have a miniature score. I suppose only the wizard can find it! Thanks, Ginny.
20:44:56 - Ginny Boehme : Yes, I would guess there is some other secret to finding that one. I'm happy I was able to help! Let me know if I can try to find something else for you :)
20:45:27 - Patron : By the way, there are tons of musicians with your last name. Have a great evening and thanks a lot!
20:45:50 - Ginny Boehme : Yes there are! You have a great evening too :)

Did you see my answer in the previous chat? We have two copies of Physical chemistry for the life sciences by Atkins (which I think is the same book) on reserve at King Library for CHM 471/472. They can be used for two hours in the library. Just stop at the main desk to the left of the front entrance.
11:30:43 - Patron : It is now allowed to take in hoe?
11:30:47 - Patron : home?
11:31:27 - Barry Zaslow : No, the loan rule for that is ""no overnight reserve"" which means the King staff and professor agreed to that. If you need an exception you will have to discuss that with the course instructor.
11:32:30 - Patron : It is for CHM 572
11:33:05 - Patron : It is also same rule for CHM 572?
11:33:39 - Barry Zaslow : I don't see anything on reserve for CHM 572--best to ask at the King desk to be sure.
11:34:04 - Patron : I will. Thank you.
11:34:25 - Barry Zaslow : You're welcome. King is open 7am-1am every day now except holidays or Spring Break

Is this for a business course? If you share the course abbreviation, we may have a library guide put together for your assignment that I can reference.
17:16:04 - Patron : Yes it is. MKT 495. Thank you!
17:16:11 - Laura Birkenhauer : Thanks! Let me check on this now.
17:16:48 - Laura Birkenhauer : Is your professor Oakenfull?
17:16:50 - Laura Birkenhauer : Or someone else?
17:17:11 - Patron : No, mine is Denman, but I think the information for Oakenfull would still be relevant??
17:18:13 - Laura Birkenhauer : Here's the guide: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/oakenfull495"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/oakenfull495</a> Often, a librarian will put together a guide for a specific assignment, so it may not be 100% relevant to your assignment. As a next step, I can take a look at some of the databases and see what I can find about this company. If all else fails, your best bet will be working with Abi Morgan, our Business Librarian (her info is on this guide!)
17:19:12 - Laura Birkenhauer : Here's Abi's main Business guide. It lists a few databases for company research: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/bus"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/bus</a>
17:19:17 - Laura Birkenhauer : I'll check a few of those out now
17:19:29 - Patron : Ahhhh, okay. It looks like the website for Oakenfull's is from last semester, so it won't help anymore, but I'll still check it out. I may reach out to Abi soon, too. Thank you so much! This chat feature is so helpful!
17:20:53 - Laura Birkenhauer : That sounds good! I'm glad to hear it! I'll see if I can find anything through the company research databases and send anything I find to you here. It definitely doesn't hurt to reach out to Abi - she may be able to help via email or if you prefer an in-person appointment, she can work with you that way too
17:21:11 - Patron : Great! Sounds good. Thanks again!

16:19:15 - Patron : I have to include the full references for my three research study articles.
16:19:40 - Patron : it is for MBI 361W
16:19:49 - Stefanie Hilles : Do you want to cite an entire journal or an article?
16:20:15 - Patron : an article, sorry
16:20:37 - Patron : i just don't know what tool to use to cite
16:21:03 - Patron : for the full references
16:23:21 - Stefanie Hilles : I can help you format your own citations and provide links as I did above but I am not an expert on zotero and I do not know how to cite in NLM there. I can give you an email of another librarian with more zotero experience to contact if you'd like
16:24:22 - Stefanie Hilles : It looks like you might need to add the style?
16:24:26 - Stefanie Hilles : <a href=""https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=nlm"" target=""_blank"">https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=nlm</a>
16:25:22 - Stefanie Hilles : Ginny Boehme is great with zotero and is also a science librarian so will probably know NLM. Her email is boehmemv@miamioh.edu 
16:25:44 - Patron : okay thank you i will email her!

 User: Kristen Adams

","43","","11:41:41 - Kristen Adams : Hello
11:41:57 - Kristen Adams : We can check if there is a course guide that might help
11:42:19 - Patron : Okay. Thanks.
11:42:32 - Kristen Adams : <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/soc153"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/soc153</a>
11:43:02 - Kristen Adams : Does this look like the right course?
11:43:57 - Patron : Yes. However, I tried some of those databases out and was not really finding an actual research report. I am sort of stuck.
11:44:37 - Kristen Adams : do you mean research articles, like in peer reviewed journals, or reports from other organizations?
11:46:31 - Patron : It does not specify in my assignment, but I would probably say short peer reviewed journals where it goes through the research conducted and not just critique.
11:46:51 - Kristen Adams : oh ok, so a primary research article
11:47:02 - Patron : yes! exactly
11:47:05 - Kristen Adams : got it
11:47:06 - Kristen Adams : ok
11:47:34 - Kristen Adams : have you tried SocIndex? <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/socindex-with-full-text"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/socindex-with-full-text</a>
11:47:55 - Patron : I do not think so.
11:47:57 - Kristen Adams : that's on of the bigger databases for sociology 
11:48:39 - Patron : Okay. I'll try it.
11:48:46 - Kristen Adams : sounds good.
11:50:57 - Patron : One of the other things I was struggling with was what to search for. My assignment wants me to find research on different areas like gender, race, alcohol, parenting, etc. I don't know what to search for without being too broad or too specific.
11:52:02 - Kristen Adams : are there other details to the assignment? I'm not sure either, you would want to pair those kinds of things with some other topic or a place
11:53:30 - Patron : Discuss the details about each research e.g. where was it done and by whom and when was it published, the findings, and how it is useful for your lives and/or the lives of others. Please DO NOT choose all your researches in the same area e.g. drugs and alcohol or mental health - choose researches from 4 distinctly different areas e.g. gender, race, alcohol, parenting, education, aging, crime etc. Give examples of at least FOUR REAL researches that can make a difference in your life or in the lives of others based on findings/conclusions from these sociological researches (hint: look up/search short sociological research reports on family or crime or drugs and alcohol or religion or gender or in medical sociology etc., note their findings and exercise critical thinking as to how they could make a difference in your life or in the life of others and use them in your discussion). This is what the assignment says.
11:54:40 - Kristen Adams : Seems like it's up to you, but the professor wants you to choose some variety
11:55:26 - Kristen Adams : You could do a certain population and one of the topics here, like say mental health and elderly in America, or drug use and teeagers
11:55:42 - Patron : I searched ""research"" and ""gender"" and that came up with a lot of results but not too many actual research reports.
11:56:18 - Kristen Adams : I'm sure there were a lot of results, you'd want to add in more topics to narrow it down
11:56:48 - Kristen Adams : say gender, plus an age group or socioeconomic status
11:56:55 - Kristen Adams : or a particlar place
11:57:13 - Patron : Okay. Thanks. I will add more topics.
11:57:18 - Kristen Adams : your welcome
11:57:46 - Kristen Adams : We are at a time where we trade shifts, I'm going to bring in Katie, who could continue helping you if you need it.
11:57:59 - Patron : okay.
11:58:18 - Kristen Adams : Katie is now here, if you need help narrowing down your topic
11:58:37 - Katie Gibson : Happy to help
11:58:45 - Katie Gibson : let me know if there is any other information you need
11:58:48 - Kristen Adams : Thanks Katie
11:58:56 - Katie Gibson : You're welcome!
12:20:46 - Patron : I just want to make sure that I'm on the right track. Would this source be an example of sociological research? <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=sih&amp;AN=176910818&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=sih&amp;AN=176910818&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a>
12:21:04 - Katie Gibson : Let me take a look and I'll get back to you
12:21:06 - Katie Gibson : One moment
12:22:28 - Katie Gibson : It looks like it to me. But, I do want to qualify this with I am a Humanities librarian. You might want to run this past either your professor or the Sociology librarian, Megan Jaskowiak (jaskowma@miamioh.edu)
12:26:02 - Patron : Okay. I think it should be good because it mentions the procedure and methods. My professor did not specify what was good sociological research in the assignment. It seems to be very broad.
12:26:32 - Katie Gibson : I would say if it's an original research study published in a peer reviewed journal, that's a good indicator. 
12:26:48 - Katie Gibson : And this fits both of those.
12:28:09 - Patron : Okay.

09:23:00 - Barry Zaslow : It looks like there is a print copy on reserve at King Library circulation desk since Fall 2023. Does this help?
09:24:18 - Barry Zaslow : If you want the library to get an online version you may want to reach out to Megan Jaskowiak, the FSW subject librarian although I'm not sure we can do that given budget constraints. She's at jaskowma@miamioh.edu
09:24:18 - Patron : To be honest, the reason I need the electronic version is so that I can enlarge the type. I am an older returning student and am having difficulty with eyestrain. Is there an online version?
09:25:02 - Patron : Ok Thank you!
09:25:16 - Barry Zaslow : One option if you do use the print version is to use the book scanner at King and enlarge the pages--the people at circulation should be able to help
09:25:52 - Patron : Ok Thanks! I was not aware of that service.
09:26:11 - Barry Zaslow : Or even the photocopier if it's not too many pages (scanning is no charge, copying 10 cents per page)
09:32:49 - Barry Zaslow : I went ahead and asked Megan about this so you don't have to.

17:08:30 - Mark Dahlquist : So, let's see...how many additional articles do you need at this point?
17:10:59 - Mark Dahlquist : One idea for searching for additional articles on this topic could be to search for the title of one of these articles in Google Scholar (from the Miami Library homepage), and then to look at articles that have cited that article since it came out.
17:11:47 - Mark Dahlquist : I hope these articles are enough to give you a good start. Library chat closes at 5pm, so I will need to log off in a moment.

15:27:19 - Katie Gibson : We're the university library rather than a local library... are you interested in pubic libraries? Or are you including universities?
15:27:50 - Katie Gibson : I don't know if we have hard numbers but I'll look to see if we have a number somewhere. 
15:27:54 - Patron : This library was an option for the assignment so we are all good

15:28:05 - Katie Gibson : Ah ok... let me see if I can find out one moment
15:29:42 - Katie Gibson : Ah, I just talked to the librarian responsible for that part of the library
15:29:59 - Katie Gibson : and in our ""classic catalog"" here are all the items with a location code as being in that part of the building: <a href=""https://holmes.lib.miamioh.edu/search/X?SEARCH=(*)&amp;searchscope=9&amp;SORT=D&amp;b=imc"" target=""_blank"">https://holmes.lib.miamioh.edu/search/X?SEARCH=(*)&amp;searchscope=9&amp;SORT=D&amp;b=imc</a>

15:31:58 - Katie Gibson : I'm happy to help
15:32:20 - Patron : How many books can an individual check out at one time here, and is this different for an educator?
15:33:03 - Katie Gibson : I am not sure... if there is a limit, it is quite high
15:33:36 - Katie Gibson : But you need to be affiliated to the university to check books out... either as faculty staff or student or as a member of our community borrower program
15:34:43 - Patron : Okay this works, thank you! What are some other materials that are able to be checked out here other than books? If there are any
15:35:15 - Katie Gibson : In that area of the library specifically, or the whole library?
15:35:35 - Katie Gibson : In that area we have all kinds of learning materials, kits, games, etc. along with kids books
15:35:45 - Patron : Just in the library in alumni hall
15:35:56 - Katie Gibson : Ooooh, that's the art library
15:36:32 - Katie Gibson : In that case, there are no childrens books in there... the children's books are in the main library, King
15:37:32 - Patron : Oh okay, sorry for the confusion! We can definitely use this information about King Library as well for the assignment.
15:37:39 - Katie Gibson : Oh, ok! 
15:38:09 - Patron : What do you have to do to qualify for educator services?
15:38:36 - Katie Gibson : Nope, anybody affiliated with the university can borrow items
15:38:59 - Katie Gibson : If somebody is not a Miami faculty staff or student, they can join our community borrower program 
15:39:10 - Katie Gibson : but it's not specifically for educators
15:39:52 - Katie Gibson : this page has a good overview of what's in that part of the library: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/imc"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/imc</a>
15:40:18 - Patron : So to my understanding, there is no difference between student and staff access to King Library resources?
15:40:37 - Katie Gibson : Staff and faculty have longer due dates, but otherwise it's the same
15:41:44 - Patron : Great, thank you Katie Gibson! This was very helpful for my assignment. Have a lovely day!

If you go to OhioLINK on the library home page <a href=""http://www.lib.miamioh.edu"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lib.miamioh.edu</a> and put in the title you should see these. Does this help at all?
11:06:02 - Patron : I couldn't find that specific one. I was able to find them for other tests but not the 043 Special education. If it is not currently available is the library able to order it?
11:06:48 - Barry Zaslow : I see this title in OhioLINK: 

OAE special education (043) secrets study guide
11:06:57 - Barry Zaslow : Is that not what we are searching for?

11:10:26 - Barry Zaslow : If you think this is something we should own locally you can reach out to our Education liaison Jaclyn Spraetz (spraetj@miamioh.edu) to request a purchase. I can't guarantee that she will be able to do this as our budget is quite limited and we stop buying things next Friday but it's worth asking.
11:11:05 - Patron : Maybe I am clicking something that is blocking my search
11:11:31 - Barry Zaslow : You would need to click on the blue words OhioLINK first, then put in the title
11:13:11 - Patron : I found it! Thank you so much!
11:13:41 - Barry Zaslow : I didn't check all the editions to see if any are available but if so you can use the blue (or green) Request Item button
11:16:35 - Patron : They seem to be local use only.
11:17:18 - Barry Zaslow : Oh, that's unfortunate. Perhaps contacting Jaclyn would be the best course of action right now. These tests/guides are often restricted and/or always in use.
11:18:17 - Barry Zaslow : If you are able to travel and they are owned at Univ. of Cincinnati or Xavier or Wright State or U. Dayton those locations aren't too far away.
11:20:46 - Patron : I am a UD alumni so that is a perfect location!

12:36:33 - Patron : Along that network there were various stops—villages, towns and outposts called cavaranserais—scattered about a day’s hike apart. Few travelers covered the Silk Road’s expanse, which stretched for thousands of miles from East Asia to Turkey. Instead, caravans of traders and camels traveled back and forth between the local nodes, trading their wares for other goods, gold or money, and then returned home. (Here’s a map of the basic route, from The Miami University Silk Road Project.)

16:40:18 - Patron : thank you
16:40:34 - Stefanie Hilles : No problem!
16:41:03 - Mark Dahlquist : Hi Marty, I'm happy to provide some more information on this.
16:41:34 - Patron : hello again - i went to google scholar and I've typed in both the authors and when that didn't work the title and i'm still not getting anywhere OR i get an incomplete article
16:42:52 - Mark Dahlquist : Yes, this was a little tricky to find, I searched by title in quotation marks in Google Scholar, and the second result provided was a full text one.
16:42:59 - Mark Dahlquist : I also grabbed the url for this Journal in Proquest: 
<a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/publication/26142?accountid=12434&amp;decadeSelected=2020+-+2029&amp;yearSelected=2025&amp;monthSelected=01&amp;daySelected=&amp;timeSelected=&amp;issueNameSelected=02025Y01Y01$23Win"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/publication/26142?accountid=12434&amp;decadeSelected=2020+-+2029&amp;yearSelected=2025&amp;monthSelected=01&amp;daySelected=&amp;timeSelected=&amp;issueNameSelected=02025Y01Y01$23Win</a>
16:43:50 - Patron : While I know that librarians are magical - - what did you put in quotes that led to the article coming up. And..i gave up on proquest after trying to figure it out. it kept saying check with MU
16:43:59 - Mark Dahlquist : For some reason, the second citation that appears for ""Craft Schedules That<br />Work for Everyone"" doesn't *look* like the right article, but it is.
16:44:39 - Mark Dahlquist : Hmm let me try this againb.
16:45:06 - Patron : ok. I'll try. It's just that I want to know how to find articles or even just browse the journals
16:46:34 - Mark Dahlquist : Yes, you can browse this journal with the link I sent above. Also, checking again, I see that you need to click the ""full view"" search result in Google Scholar rather than that ""html"" view.
16:47:14 - Mark Dahlquist : Let me see if a title search for this article will also work in the ""Articles and More"" search from the library homepage. Hold one one moment, please.

19:21:55 - Jaclyn Spraetz : It doesn't look like this has been digitized so there is not an option to download it. You can also come to the library to view it without a library card. If you live outside of Oxford, you can also work with your local library to do an interlibrary loan where that library borrows it from us for you to check out
19:24:01 - Patron : Okay. What I am doing is submitting it to my current doctoral program so that they can view it for proof of my knowledge of research and statistics skills. The ePlus credit team at my university needs to see it.
19:24:12 - Patron : Can it be digitized?
19:26:06 - Jaclyn Spraetz : The best person to talk to about the possibility of digitizing this would be Carla Myers who does this service for Miami University faculty and students. You can reach her by email at myersc2@miamioh.edu. She would be able to answer your question about this

How can I help you today?
13:49:12 - Patron : I am supposed to ask a librarian some questions for an assignment. my first question is how many childrens books do you have available to check out?
13:51:48 - Barry Zaslow : I'm not sure I have figures like that available. There are at least 12,000 in the Instructional Materials center on King Ground Floor but also some at other libraries in Hamilton and Middletown, Special Collections, and Storage. Does this help?
13:52:34 - Patron : Yes that does help thank you!
13:53:11 - Patron : My next question is, how many books can I check out at one time and is this different if you are a professor?
13:54:20 - Barry Zaslow : I think anyone can check out up to 999 books at one time. Professors just get longer loan periods like a year. Undergrads three weeks, grads a semester. Different rules for OhioLINK as well.
13:55:42 - Patron : That is a lot more than I expected! And then, what other materials or things are available for checkout?
13:57:34 - Barry Zaslow : Other than books, we have videos, audio recordings, sheet music, maps, games, kits, puppets, journals (magazines), electronic books and journal articles that you can read online or as PDFs and printout
13:59:42 - Patron : Oh cool! thank you, and then do you have any of the following resources for professors/educators; collection cards, book collection requests, book mobile, audio books, and digital books?
14:01:55 - Barry Zaslow : We have some digital books but no collection cards, book mobile and hardly any audio books. If professors want to request books for the collection they can ask their subject librarians herehttps://www.lib.miamioh.edu/about/organization/liaisons/ or use the feedback form on our main website <a href=""http://www.lib.miamioh.edu"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lib.miamioh.edu</a>

Did your professor say such a book exists, or are you just trying to find sources for this question? It might be more likely in journal articles but I can look for both.

However, I did want to ask the library about this and double-check, or see if there is something similar I can find.  if I am unable to locate a book I can locate another peer-reviewed article which he said we can do as an alternative.

15:56:01 - Mark Dahlquist : You can see in these results that I've checked the box on in the left-hand column to limit these results to peer-reviewed articles only. <br />
15:56:44 - Mark Dahlquist : However, there are still more than 80,000 results. It might be a good idea to try to limit this search more by adding some additional search terms.
15:57:21 - Mark Dahlquist : For example, are you interested in children's performance in school, their mental or physical health, etc?
15:58:05 - Mark Dahlquist : Is there some particular areas of interest that you have with regard to the children of single parents?
15:58:57 - Patron : this is my topic ""Challenges of single parenting and child well-being.""
15:59:05 - Patron : specifically the ages of 4-6
15:59:11 - Patron : in the US
16:00:20 - Patron : actually sorry the age range is 3-4 years old
16:01:58 - Mark Dahlquist : I see. There will probably not be good results for a search for 3-4 years old, so you may need to use a term such as pre-school.

16:06:03 - Mark Dahlquist : One way to improve this search might be to consider what aspects of well-being are of greatest interest. You might search for issues related to mental health, physical health, or educational attainment, for example,
16:07:57 - Mark Dahlquist : If these results are not quite what you were looking for, you might also try the ""Google Scholar"" tab on the library homepage.

Can you tell me a bit more such as the subject, perhaps the class?
09:58:15 - Patron : Yes, it is for my management class talking about decision styles and how it affected the UK Post Office scandal
10:02:03 - Barry Zaslow : It looks like the Business Source Complete database would be a good one for that. You can access this from the library home page <a href=""http://www.lib.miamioh.edu"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lib.miamioh.edu</a> using the Databases A-Z button. I tried a sample search putting ""post office"" ""scandal"" and ""Great Britain"" [you could also try ""United Kingdom"" or a specific country such as ""England""] in the boxes and asked it to search for TX all text. There were a lot of matches so you might want to limit to certain years or other criteria. Does this sound helpful?
10:04:23 - Patron : yes, I am looking for statistics on 1. why using third party resources is helpful 2. why people are worried to mess up at work 3. statistic about impulsive decision making 4. importance of checking data
10:09:39 - Barry Zaslow : Are all these related to the post office topic? I'm not sure these concepts would have statistics but I'm not a business expert. You might want to at least look at some of the articles. Also, if this does not seem to be going in the direction you prefer I suggest you reach out to Abi Morgan, the librarian who assists with management and other Farmer classes at morgan55@miamioh.edu. She's very helpful and would likely have more insight.
10:09:53 - Patron : Thank you, sounds good

12:25:00 - Patron : At first I was searching for perspectives emotional impact on readers, however, I broaden the search to just first person vs third person point of view. But none of the articles seems to relate to what I am looking for.

Have you tried the Articles &amp; More search on the library webpage? You should be able to limit to peer review/scholarly from there. You could also use a more specific index in Databases A-Z such as PubMed or Web of Science. You might want to try different keyword combinations but your substance abuse rehab looks like a good set with which to start. Does this help?
19:41:24 - Barry Zaslow : If you are doing this for a nursing program you might use CINAHL in Databases A-Z which focuses on that field. It also has a way to check peer-reviewed and you can limit by date (perhaps the last 10 years if you need current scholarship)
19:42:25 - Patron : okay thanks! I am doing this for a social work course
19:43:31 - Barry Zaslow : There is also SocIndex in the Database A-Z list which could be more related as well.
19:45:59 - Barry Zaslow : Many of these have the Ebsco interface which may look familiar if you have searched for articles before. They provide a lot of our databases and you can combine searching in several at once by going to the ""choose databases"" blue link at the top once you have selected one, but you may find enough in one of these by itself.

14:20:35 - Patron : The main thing that I am struggling with is finding articles that actually align with those things that I mentioned, and when I do find them they are normally not academic journals, which is what I need. I feel that I am not seeing articles that are about Apple Inc. marketing, campaigns, advertising, consumer base, etc.
14:20:57 - Stefanie Hilles : So none of those articles are what you're looking for?
14:21:18 - Patron : It doesn't look like it.

Hi Nancy,

Thanks for your question about placing promotional materials on plastic A-frames outside King Library. This webpage (and this one) provide information about A-Frames on the Miami Oxford campus, and I've been told that Duncan Underhill, who is a Design Production Manager in Housing, Dining, Recreation &amp; Business Services (underhdc@miamioh.edu) is a good contact for this question.

The Libraries are not generally involved with A-Frame placement around campus (including those in front of King), but if you have library-related communication questions, you can reach our to Katelyn DeGregorio at degregk@miamioh.edu.

Best regards,
Mark [Mark Dahlquist]","15:49:01 - Mark Dahlquist : Hi thanks for this question. Hold on one moment please, while I check on this.

17:22:04 - Patron : And this is what he said "" These articles must all be from the peer-reviewed literature and at least one must be from the “primary” literature. That is, it should be the first report of experimental work, not a review of previous work. There are far too many journals that publish these papers to list here, but a good example is The Journal of Organic ChemistryLinks to an external site., published by the American Chemical Society. To find your articles, you will want to use the library’s resourcesLinks to an external site. (e.g., SciFinder, Web of Science).

The types of papers you choose will depend on your chosen topic. That said, for a paper on a name reaction you would probably want to cover the discovery of the reaction and an example of a total synthesis involving that reaction. For a paper on a pharmaceutical you would probably want to cover the discovery of the pharmaceutical and an example of a synthesis that has been developed.""
17:22:41 - Stefanie Hilles : Gotchu! Thanks. Let me take a look at that second article again now that i have a better understanding
17:23:01 - Patron : Yes, that is correct. A primary source would need to be peer reviewed, but also done by the person who did the research themselves
17:23:53 - Stefanie Hilles : In the arts/humanities it is either the artwork or something that was written (or photographed, etc) during the same time period
17:24:30 - Patron : Yeah so sort of a different meaning in the two fields.
17:25:08 - Patron : In this case it would be a paper wrote by someone who did the research rather than a paper done by another who references research
17:25:38 - Stefanie Hilles : Gotchu. Taking a look at that second article again. It might be primary?
17:25:53 - Patron : Yeah I can't really tell.
17:26:39 - Stefanie Hilles : If I can't figure it out, I will give you the email of our health sciences librarian. She is awesome and would probably know in 3 seconds
17:27:02 - Patron : Haha okay, thank you!
17:28:32 - Patron : I dont think it is, I thinks its more informative than research based
17:29:05 - Patron : You did say it was peer reviewed though right?
17:29:45 - Stefanie Hilles : I don't think it is primary either. I don't know what half the words mean but I am not seeing an original experiement referenced anywhere. 
17:29:52 - Stefanie Hilles : It is peer reviewed. Yes

12:08:23 - Laura Birkenhauer : The Acting Head of the B.E.S.T. Library during that time was Kevin Messner, who is also still an employee here. I'll share his info here: messnekr@miamioh.edu, (513) 529-7204, office: 208 King Library
12:09:07 - Laura Birkenhauer : Those are some options that you could list. You can also contact Miami University's central Human Resource department for more info. I'll get that more you now.
12:09:51 - Laura Birkenhauer : You can give HR a call at 513-529-3131
12:13:15 - Patron : He may have done both, but I don't remember for sure.
12:13:34 - Patron : Oh, yes, it was
12:13:40 - Patron : Thomas Tully
12:14:37 - Laura Birkenhauer : Unfortunately Thomas Tully is no longer employed by the Libraries. Kevin may have been his direct supervisor, so he could potentially be listed. 
12:14:49 - Laura Birkenhauer : I'd ask Miami's HR what to do!
12:14:49 - Patron : I think Sandy Burwell was the one who hired me, so she might be worth contacting too?
12:15:03 - Laura Birkenhauer : Sandy also doesn't work at Miami anymore - she has retired.
12:15:41 - Patron : Sounds like giving HR a call is my best move. Thank you!
12:15:49 - Laura Birkenhauer : You're very welcome!

14:07:18 - Laura Birkenhauer : That appears to be one of the stories in the collection that I sent
14:07:28 - Laura Birkenhauer : Are you hoping I'll check and see if we have access to the story by itself?
14:07:33 - Patron : yes
14:07:41 - Laura Birkenhauer : Got it, let me see if that's an option
14:09:47 - Laura Birkenhauer : It's not looking like we have access to the story individually, either in print or digitally
14:09:54 - Laura Birkenhauer : I'd recommend requesting the copy that OSU has
14:10:58 - Patron : is there a digital version that I request?
14:11:27 - Laura Birkenhauer : There is not, I already checked
14:11:41 - Laura Birkenhauer : The print option at OSU is the only option I've found
14:12:15 - Laura Birkenhauer : You could place an interlibrary loan and request a digital copy of the story, but you'll likely be told my the ILL staff that you need to request that print copy

16:22:05 - Jaclyn Spraetz : It looks like this book is only available for one person to view at a time. For some reason it is listed twice but it looks like they are both the same e-copy. You may want to wait a little bit and then try again in an hour or so. I also see that a print copy is available at King if you want to check it out. However, with Spring Break, it looks like the library will be back open on Sunday

16:27:45 - Jaclyn Spraetz : If I were you, I would go ahead and create an EBSCO account just to see if you are able to access the book that way. That is strange to be getting this message. I'm also around if you want to give me a call. My office phone is 513-529-1747

18:54:49 - Patron : thank you
18:56:54 - Stefanie Hilles : I am not finding anything in MLA that fits this bill. Can you tell me more about your argument? That might help me thing of something
18:59:48 - Patron : I need to make an argument connecting two of the readings I had in class. I chose Challenger deep and Just the nicest couple. I have to write about how the the authors use complex character development and psychological states to show how the perception of reality can be distorted by mental illness and deception, which causes questions about the moral boundaries people will cross when personal crises happen.
19:03:00 - Stefanie Hilles : Well, you've found the only article in MLA that references either of the two books. I could maybe find something about how the perception of reality can be distorted by mental illness in literature in general but that's probably the best I can do if you can only use MLA
19:03:53 - Patron : Okay no worries. I'll reach out to my teacher. She requires we use the MLA international biographies
19:05:20 - Stefanie Hilles : Ok. Sorry. There are more articles if you broaden out to other databases. The MLA requirement makes it harder

10:09:01 - Roger Justus : So we have it through some databases, like Business Source Complete, but don't have an independent subscription. Also, it looks like the articles are delayed one year. There doesn't seem to be an easy way to download 10 years' worth of articles like an API or such that we have access to.. 
10:10:09 - Patron : Are you aware of an API that I can pay for to do this?
10:11:16 - Patron : Alternatively, do we have full access to similar journals; for example, the ""Journal of Quality Technology""
10:12:06 - Roger Justus : No, most of the publishers have their own based on subscription level, since we don't have the independent subscription with their publisher (Taylor and Francis). Contract-wise, we don't have access to their tools.  I can look for that journal as well.  
10:12:16 - Patron : Thank you
10:14:09 - Roger Justus : That is another T&amp;F Journal so we do not have that (they are VERY high priced and have continually raised costs year after year) you can get articles from that journal through our Interlibrary Loan program (ILL) <a href=""https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html"" target=""_blank"">https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html</a> with your Miami ID and Password
10:14:50 - Patron : I am looking to download entire issues for a research project so I do not believe ILL is suitable for that.
10:16:06 - Roger Justus : Yea, thats true.  They may be able to check if another institution has a subscription and you can contact their library to see if they can help as well? 
10:16:26 - Patron : That would be great; thank you
10:16:49 - Roger Justus : We just contractually cant do that sort of API work without a subscription.
10:18:32 - Roger Justus : Business Souce complete (which as that first one) does have a API you can see if that will work for you.  Information on that is here - <a href=""https://connect.ebsco.com/s/article/EBSCOhost-API?language=en_US"" target=""_blank"">https://connect.ebsco.com/s/article/EBSCOhost-API?language=en_US</a>

11:31:37 - Jenny Presnell : there are 800 some
11:32:09 - Jenny Presnell : browse through them and see if this is what you need -- we can maybe refine your search to be more on target

11:36:21 - Jenny Presnell : Glad to help and that this worked
11:36:28 - Jenny Presnell : let us know if you need something else
11:57:58 - Patron : Hi! I found an article in the database that I would like to use but there is not a copy provided. Is there any way to retrieve it from another source or does that mean that Miami does not have a copy?
12:01:52 - Jenny Presnell : sorry
12:02:00 - Jenny Presnell : I just found your message

12:05:57 - Jenny Presnell : and when you look for the article it looks like it isn't there
12:06:44 - Jenny Presnell : but there was a result that didn't have the article as the article title -- when I clicked that I had to use the computer's find in text button
12:07:01 - Jenny Presnell : but geeezz it does look like it isn't there
12:07:20 - Patron : oh wow. Well that was very fast in my opinion. Thank you again!

11:07:06 - Patron : Part 1: Select one case study, either the Salmonellosis case, Zika virus case, or Measles case from Chapter 10. Answer the three questions at the end of the case. If your selected case has more than 3 questions, just choose 3 of the questions to respond to for this assignment. 

This part of your assignment should be less than one page single-spaced. 

Part 2: Based on the case you selected, review the literature for an article related to this outbreak, or a similar outbreak. The article should be an original study, in which authors analyzed epidemiological data and developed conclusions based on the data. This should not be a review of other studies. This part of your assignment should be 500-600 words. The Finding Epidemiological StudiesLinks to an external site. tab of the NSG 646 library research guide will help you find an original study about your selected outbreak..

12:39:05 - Jenny Presnell : hi
12:39:45 - Jenny Presnell : When you say the meeting are you looking at the federal level congress

12:41:36 - Jenny Presnell : looking at the county's history page
12:41:59 - Patron : Probably not. When people got together to form Ohio and name the counties. I need to uncover who said what in relation to the naming of the original counties, particularly Warren, Butler, Montgomery and Hamilton.
12:42:00 - Jenny Presnell : it says at the first general assembly
12:42:12 - Jenny Presnell : of Ohio

12:43:11 - Jenny Presnell : i'll be back
12:44:18 - Patron : I need the back and forth conversations of who said what during those proceedings. Who made what motions, etc.
12:45:53 - Jenny Presnell : right that would be the first assembly record in 1803
12:48:15 - Jenny Presnell : this is going to take me a bit -- we had a database but I think we had to cancel it. If I can have your email address, I'll send either a link or a copy from our print edition

18:20:50 - Barry Zaslow : That system is kind of beyond my knowledge at the libraries and of course most of the office people (in the CPA or Presser or other academic buildings) are on a daytime 8am-5pm schedule.

09:47:21 - Barry Zaslow : You can also narrow it down to peer reviewed using the check boxes on the left if that would be helpful, or full-text only
09:48:35 - Barry Zaslow : It might be a lot to wade through and some were more relevant than others so the more limits you place the fewer you will get--if it narrows too much you can always uncheck one of the boxes or add in years

You can email her, schedule an appointment, or utilize her office hours

13:37:58 - Ginny Boehme : Statista is probably not the best resource to get general info like that. It's great for specific industries, but I'm not seeing much of anything on conversion rates/effectiveness

13:39:32 - Patron : what question would you suggest to ask when looking for research and how should we refine it down to get the best information possible
13:39:41 - Ginny Boehme : Something like Business Source Complete (also linked on that page) might be better for finding general info about conversion
13:40:55 - Ginny Boehme : It depends on what your information need is. Some of our databases are great at one thing but terrible at others. I suggest at this stage that you talk to our business librarian, Abi Morgan (her info is also on that page I linked) and see if she can help you narrow in on some good questions. She knows more about your class resources than I do
13:42:00 - Patron : Ok thank, have a great day. I appreciate your time

12:58:23 - Patron : Okay. He is very responsive by chance?
12:58:45 - Jaclyn Spraetz : It would make sense to me if you used Spotify because they are the actual album. It might be helpful to look online for lists on albums from the 60s to 90s to give you ideas and then you can look it up on Spotify

15:03:17 - Katie Gibson : If you'd like a private place, you are able to reserve a regular study room for two hours

This is Sarah Meaney!!!
17:53:33 - Roger Justus : Hi Sarah!!!
17:53:38 - Patron : I was just thinking about you today too!!
17:54:02 - Roger Justus : Depends on which ones you want!  Sometimes they ship them to our offsite.  Do you have one in particular you are looking for?  
17:54:24 - Roger Justus : Cool, we have another game night on the 3rd of May if you want some fun too!
17:55:11 - Patron : I have three names:  Loveness Ngorosha, Jody Googins, and Chloe Bolyard
17:55:23 - Roger Justus : Ok give me a second and let me see what I can find
17:55:28 - Patron : They wrote dissertations for Educational Leadeship
17:55:39 - Patron : But I am not sure how long ago.  Tom Poetter was their adviser
17:56:06 - Patron : Also, thanks for the Game Night tip!!  I will put it on my calendar, but that weekend is really filling up!
17:56:16 - Roger Justus : I am sure that weekend seems packed
17:58:12 - Roger Justus : So where you would typically search for them is in Scholarly Commons (https://sc.lib.miamioh.edu/) which of course is down right now...(I am getting a ticket in) I am going to take a quick look at our catalog and see if I can find any of them that way too!
17:58:16 - Patron : We have friends in town, but I would love to show off our vibrant community!
17:58:28 - Patron : Perfect!  You are my hero!

18:01:46 - Roger Justus : so that is the link to what we show for Goggins and Bolyard.  

Ngorosha look like there are 3?...and here is that link <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip&amp;bquery=Ngorosha&amp;cli0=FT1&amp;clv0=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip&amp;bquery=Ngorosha&amp;cli0=FT1&amp;clv0=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site</a>
18:03:36 - Roger Justus : if those arent them, let me know and when we get the Commons back up (tomorrow most likely) I will take a look there as well.
18:07:40 - Patron : I am back, sorry!  Let me check out those docs
18:07:46 - Roger Justus : No worries at all
18:11:26 - Patron : This is it!!  Down a little bit in the searches, but I have all three on Zotero now!

13:56:27 - Laura Birkenhauer : I haven't found anything useful on that question in my search. A lot of the articles written are on a very specific topic, and - my best guess - strong strategies for one product or demographic may not apply to all. I can switch over to Articles &amp; More and try to search a bit more there. You may need to talk with Abi, though, like I mentioned. It's her area of expertise, not mine!

14:03:00 - Laura Birkenhauer : I am not finding anything that fits the bill. All the articles I'm finding are specific to certain industries, for example. Sometimes what helps is taking a look at a book, because they tend to be a bit more general than news, magazine, trade or academic publications. However, I'd really recommend you connect with Abi. Again, she's the subject specialist librarian in this area. She's been working with students who have this same topic/prompt and are in your class, so she'll have good advice for you.

10:51:08 - Patron : the APF is about 3350
10:51:14 - Patron : We're trying to sort out payment
10:51:26 - Patron : Based on my reading, Miami University doesnt have a special deal with them correct?
10:52:32 - Patron : Our financial admin had some questions about how PREP works.
10:52:40 - Roger Justus : Understable, Miami, through our OhioLink membership, has some agreements with certain publishers, but not all.
10:52:58 - Patron : 1) How quickly is the turn around time for approval? So as not to delay publication? 2) Can we just pay ahead of time with start-up and get reimbursed? 3) Is the PREP program competitive? As in there is a chance I may not get it or is it more or less a sure thing?
10:55:15 - Roger Justus : The PREP program is run by the Office of Research and Innovation, which would be the best place to contact for specific examples about how the program works. From what I have seen from experience working with others, they are fairly quick, and they are trying to help with this sort of fee in particular, so you should have a good chance of getting them to help. 
10:55:48 - Patron : ahh gotcha
10:55:49 - Roger Justus : But again the Office of Research and Innovation (ORI) is the best to contact with specific questions.
10:55:52 - Patron : I will contact them
10:56:04 - Patron : appreciate it
10:56:43 - Roger Justus : No worries at all, we have a guide to that program and the ones from OhioLink, give me a sec and I will drop the link in here.

18:06:35 - Patron : I want to confirm some articles are peer-reviewed.
18:08:07 - Nate Floyd : I see. If it were me, I'd make a list of the journals and then go one-by-one checking their publisher website. Or, I would search for those articles again in Articles and More (on our website), narrow the results by peer review status, and if your articles shows up, it's been peer reviewed 
18:08:12 - Nate Floyd : How many articles do you have? 
18:10:01 - Patron : Several but I'm narrowing it down to 3. I'll go with your 2nd suggestion. Thanks Nate.
18:10:57 - Nate Floyd : OK great if you have the list handy I can take a quick look 
18:12:04 - Patron : 1. Integrating Indigenous Traditional Ecological Knowledge of land into land management through Indigenous-academic partnerships
18:12:19 - Patron : 2. Traditional ecological knowledge sustains
due to poverty and lack of choices rather
than thinking about the environment
18:12:56 - Patron : 3. Why is traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) maintained?
An answer to Hartel et al. (2023)
18:13:15 - Patron : 4. Identifying intangible and biocultural heritage elements toward
environmental understanding: engaging stakeholders through art
18:13:31 - Patron : 5. Indigenous Stewardship of Ancestral Lands Activates Land and Culture: Will We Listen?
18:13:59 - Patron : 6. The genetically engineered American chestnut tree as opportunity for reciprocal restoration in Haudenosaunee communities
18:14:20 - Patron : 7. A Case for Developing Place-Based Fire Management Strategies from Traditional Ecological Knowledge
18:14:43 - Patron : 8. Traditional ecological knowledge of mangrove wood use
on the Brazilian Amazon coast
18:15:22 - Nate Floyd : I'm not entirely sure about #5 (Indigenous Stewardship of Ancestral Lands Activates Land and Culture: Will We Listen?), but the all the others are peer reviewed 
18:15:29 - Nate Floyd : You have good sources! 
18:16:44 - Patron : Thanks :) Do you know of another way to check #5? You mentioned going to the publisher's website?
18:17:37 - Patron : I went there but I'm still not sure how to tell its peer-reviewed.
18:18:34 - Nate Floyd : It looks like only certain parts of that journal are peer reviewed: <a href=""https://escholarship.org/uc/psf/submissionGuidelines"" target=""_blank"">https://escholarship.org/uc/psf/submissionGuidelines</a>
18:18:46 - Nate Floyd : ""We welcome proposals for three departments of the journal: full-length articles for “New Perspectives” (which undergo an internal PSF editorial review) and “Advances in Research and Management” (which undergo double-blind external peer review), and visual essays for “The Photographer’s Frame” (reviewed by the journal’s Photo Editors). Instructions for submissions are later in this document. We also welcome proposals for sets of theme papers; contact the editors at <a href=""mailto:psf@georgewright.org"">psf@georgewright.org</a> for more information.""<br /><br />
18:19:09 - Nate Floyd : So if the article came from this section, Advances in Research and Management, then it was peer reviewed 
18:19:29 - Nate Floyd : I honestly don't think your professor would know the difference, tho 
18:26:45 - Patron : Not sure if this is something you can help me with, but how can I tell if the article came from Advances in Research and Management?
18:29:18 - Nate Floyd : I think we'd have to see where it appears in the issue in which it was published 
18:29:20 - Nate Floyd : like this
18:29:22 - Nate Floyd : <a href=""https://escholarship.org/uc/psf/41/1"" target=""_blank"">https://escholarship.org/uc/psf/41/1</a>
18:29:56 - Nate Floyd : Although it's a great source and written by experts
18:30:08 - Nate Floyd : I don't think it was ""peer reviewed"" 
18:30:17 - Nate Floyd : It looks like the article was part of the ""theme"" series 
18:31:01 - Patron : Ok. Thanks so much for your help.
18:31:14 - Nate Floyd : 👍️

I plan to include a zine project in my curriculum. I could be totally mistaken, but I feel like I've heard your name in reference to zine workshops. Is that correct? I've actually meant to email you about this before, so I'm especially glad you were the librarian to connect with me here.

10:14:48 - Barry Zaslow : There isn't a real pattern--each publisher has their own limits but usually they allow people to view several. If you go to the library home page <a href=""http://www.lib.miamioh.edu"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lib.miamioh.edu</a> and search Articles &amp; More it will usually say whether we have access. Also, you can use the E-Journals tab once you know the name of the journal such as in this case Journal of Psychology and Theology and it will tell what years are available. Sometimes the most recent 1-3 years are not because of copyright. Hope this makes sense

09:01:25 - Katie Gibson : Is there a particular citation style you are using?
09:01:30 - Katie Gibson : It is different in each
09:03:42 - Patron : Jennifer A. Sullivan and Deborah L. Virant, was published in the Clinical Journal of Oncology Nursing in December 2024 (Vol. 28, No. 6, pp. 551–558). for example this one? should I write the author's name indented or not?
09:04:07 - Katie Gibson : Are you citing in APA, MLA, Chicago, or another style?
09:04:18 - Patron : APA 7th ed
09:04:34 - Katie Gibson : Ah, ok. For APA, it is Author's last name, First initial. 
09:04:38 - Katie Gibson : Then the date
09:04:49 - Katie Gibson : The article title isn't in italics. But the journal title is.
09:05:58 - Katie Gibson : Grady, J. S., Her, M., Moreno, G., Perez, C., &amp; Yelinek, J. (2019). Emotions in storybooks: A comparison of storybooks that represent ethnic and racial groups in the United States. <i>Psychology of Popular Media Culture</i>, 8(3), 207–217. <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1037/ppm0000185"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.1037/ppm0000185</a> is an example of an APA citation
09:07:26 - Katie Gibson : Then, you'll want to indent any lines after the first line of the citation
09:08:52 - Patron : ok is second name (surname) comma, then first name point, if there is another first name point again then is comma, then next surname and comma and followed by first name and point... and so on
09:09:28 - Katie Gibson : You only need the initial of the first name and then the point
09:09:54 - Katie Gibson : then a , and the surname of the second author , first initial and then another point
09:10:22 - Katie Gibson : so for your article it would be Sullivan, J.A., &amp; Virant, D.L. (2024). 
09:10:56 - Patron : i got it
09:11:32 - Patron : if is more than 2 authors then continue  the same and put a &amp; before the last. Is that right?
09:12:23 - Katie Gibson : yes. If there are 3 or more authors, you can just do the first one and then put et al. 
09:12:48 - Katie Gibson : like on this page: <a href=""https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/basic-principles/author-date"" target=""_blank"">https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/basic-principles/author-date</a>
09:13:21 - Katie Gibson : that's for the in-text citation
09:13:38 - Katie Gibson : but in the bibliography, you list all authors in the format I described before
09:14:17 - Patron : wonderful
09:15:13 - Patron : i believe i've seen somewhere in the reference guide that I should only write the first 20 authors in the reference list and not the following is that right ?
09:15:33 - Katie Gibson : That I
09:15:35 - Katie Gibson : oops

09:15:49 - Katie Gibson : which reference guide are you looking at?
09:16:24 - Katie Gibson : The one I see says the same
09:16:50 - Katie Gibson : And I just found something on the APA website that confirms: <a href=""https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/more-than-20-authors"" target=""_blank"">https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/more-than-20-authors</a>
09:19:25 - Patron : I took it from King's college London website version 1.5 Libraries &amp; collections
09:19:45 - Katie Gibson : Ah... just so you know, I'm at Miami University in Ohio in the US. 
09:19:51 - Katie Gibson : but the information is still the same

09:29:58 - Katie Gibson : Ah, I see
09:30:26 - Katie Gibson : another database that might be helpful that won't get picked up in the articles and more search is Language and Linguistics Abstracts
09:30:33 - Katie Gibson : it also will have useful information
09:30:37 - Katie Gibson : let me get you that link
09:30:57 - Katie Gibson : <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/linguistics-language-behavior-abstracts"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/linguistics-language-behavior-abstracts</a>
09:31:01 - Patron : Thank you - that link you sent had articles I have not seen yet in my searchers - very helpful!
09:31:24 - Katie Gibson : Yeah TESOL is tricky because there are so many ways to say it
09:31:47 - Katie Gibson : so stringing together all the ways like TESOL or ESL or english as a second language gets all sorts of different results
09:31:58 - Patron : Thank you so much - I am going to digest the list you sent and I can chat back if I need more help.
09:32:07 - Katie Gibson : Ok, sounds good.

I wonder if you have a record or copy of his thesis--if it was required at the time he completed his masters in education.

13:40:19 - Mark Dahlquist : Do you also have the title of this thesis?
13:43:53 - Patron : I do not have a title, but I thought it might have been about the history of Ansonia, OH. It might not have been a formal thesis and maybe it was a different sort of project that he completed for the degree.
13:44:25 - Mark Dahlquist : I see, thanks! I am still checking on this. Thanks for your patience.
13:45:23 - Patron : No rush. I actually work as support staff at Alden Library at Ohio University and thought I would try out your chat service for this request.

13:53:37 - Mark Dahlquist : I can follow up via email if you'd like (I wasn't able to speak with the University Archivist), but my understanding is that MA theses from this period were not held by Miami.
13:55:21 - Patron : Thank you for checking so thoroughly. I wondered if that might have been the case.

14:40:21 - Mark Dahlquist : As you can see, this is quite a long list! We could try to narrow this down.

15:12:20 - Mark Dahlquist : Or looking at this again, it appears that we used to have this journal, but lost access in 2011. So, you will probably need to put in special ILL request for issues after that date.

If you go to the library home page <a href=""http://www.lib.miamioh.edu"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lib.miamioh.edu</a> and choose the Databases A-Z button you can put in New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and/or Cincinnati Business Courier in the search box at the left and it should tell you how to register for those. You may need to be on campus for the NYT; the CBC does not appear to require registration. Does this help?
10:20:04 - Barry Zaslow : I would suggest putting each title in separately so it doesn't get confused--that is going to each newspaper's link one at a time
10:20:31 - Patron : perfect thank you.  re: nyt - do we need to be on campus to register or to read it?
10:21:25 - Barry Zaslow : Only to sign up for it--it's a 6 month term and to renew it you may need to be on campus again at that date but you should be able to read it anywhere.
10:22:00 - Patron : I'm testing this registration process with Cincinnati Business Courier...do you mind holding a sec while I see if I can figure it out
10:22:33 - Patron : I'm not seeing the option to register...

10:23:10 - Barry Zaslow : No, the CBC is provided by the Career Center but we get just what you see on the page--no more benefits to ""registering""

11:08:11 - Barry Zaslow : I'm looking at Education Research Complete which seems to have some possibilities (limiting to peer-reviewed and most recent). Trauma is a good key word but perhaps ESL or English Language Learners seems better than ""ELL""
11:08:49 - Barry Zaslow : I did not add other phrases yet such as evidence-based or asset-based
11:09:44 - Barry Zaslow : This isn't my area of expertise so if I mis-state something please forgive
11:10:09 - Patron : I see if you find any this about asset based program instead of deficit based program....
11:10:16 - Barry Zaslow : Have you been working with Jaclyn? 
11:10:22 - Patron : That alright
11:11:13 - Patron : Abi Morgan and she is out of town do you have someone who works in special Education or ESL
11:13:06 - Barry Zaslow : Jaclyn Spraetz is our other education librarian who works chiefly with Educational Psychology and Educational Leadership but she might have more insight. Her e-mail is spraetj@miamioh.edu. I tried adding asset-based and evidence-based but those did not produce any results.
11:13:44 - Barry Zaslow : That database does seem to be one of the better ones to try, though, if you can come up with some combination of words.
11:24:12 - Barry Zaslow : Another place to try is called ERIC, although I ran into the same challenge there when adding asset or evidence, but it covers a lot of reports issued by states and boards (not exactly peer-reviewed)
11:33:45 - Barry Zaslow : I don't know if you've searched Google Scholar yet but there might be some possibilities there--We have a link from the main library page to that resource and then on the right side of the page once you put in your terms it shows how to access the articles. Many (not all) are peer-reviewed although you probably need to check the journal's main web page to ascertain that. Also ways to limit on the left by years etc.
11:36:40 - Barry Zaslow : GS appears to present a few more titles when I include asset or evidence-based but they are so diffuse you might need to sort through them to see which are relevant.
11:43:51 - Barry Zaslow : I see that Jaclyn will be on chat today (Wed. June 11th) from noon-3pm if you want to reach out to her that way given our roadblocks here--we are in King in-person usually when we are on chat--but e-mail will find her as well.

10:51:56 - Barry Zaslow : I used the DOI you gave me and opened a new window and it showed me the title of the book. For books in our collection you almost always have to go to Books &amp; More rather than One Search. When I did not see it in our collection I clicked on OhioLINK to see who else might have it which brought up the UC one, but a 13 year old CD-ROM might not work in certain desktops anymore
10:52:28 - Barry Zaslow : So I suggested trying for the chapter or book in print through ILL
10:52:36 - Patron : got it

11:13:40 - Barry Zaslow : Hello. How can I help you with this call number today?
11:13:50 - Patron : my name is Dattatraya Jadhav - you can call me DJ.  I live in Mason Ohio and want to get this book
11:14:02 - Patron : Chemical Origins and Market
11:14:20 - Patron : is it possible to collect? Do i need to be a member of library or options?
11:15:49 - Barry Zaslow : Yes. It is at King Library on the 2nd floor on our Oxford campus. You can come to the library and use it here or if you have a local public library in Mason that you are a member you can ask them to do what is called Interlibrary Loan. Does this help?
11:16:53 - Patron : Yes.  One question
11:17:03 - Patron : use it here = means i can't take it home?
11:17:26 - Barry Zaslow : Only if you are a Miami University student, staff, or faculty
11:17:44 - Patron : Or shall i got to local library and ask them to get loan, and that way i can take it home for few days?
11:18:00 - Patron : Noted on the first question
11:18:28 - Barry Zaslow : Yes, that makes sense. They may even find it at another public library in Ohio but we are not that far from Mason so they may try us first
11:18:56 - Patron : yes.  i tried all other libraries and this is only available at your library
11:18:59 - Patron : thank you
11:19:34 - Barry Zaslow : You are welcome. Good luck with your project. 
11:35:49 - Barry Zaslow : DJ--I am closing the chat window as it's been 15 minutes since we messaged. If you need further assistance there will be people here till 9pm today.

14:37:56 - Patron : Thank you
14:41:40 - Stefanie Hilles : Yes. We have a copy. However, it is offsite and, with the library updating it's catalog, I believe you will need to request it through interlibrary loan instead of through the catalog.
14:41:55 - Stefanie Hilles : Here is a link to the book: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip,url,uid,cpid&amp;custid=s9002934&amp;db=cat00344a&amp;AN=mucat.b1306512&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;profile=eds_cat"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip,url,uid,cpid&amp;custid=s9002934&amp;db=cat00344a&amp;AN=mucat.b1306512&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;profile=eds_cat</a>

14:42:54 - Stefanie Hilles : No. It is at our offsite storage facility
14:45:25 - Patron : Okay, thanks Stefanie, Yes I remember the offsite storage because that is where Susan used to get some of the publications I was looking for.  If I cannot find it anywhere else I will try to order.
14:45:51 - Stefanie Hilles : Ok! Sounds good. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
14:46:17 - Patron : Thanks I think I am all set for now.
14:46:27 - Stefanie Hilles : Then have a great day!
14:46:54 - Patron : Can you check one other book.

14:49:26 - Stefanie Hilles : If you look at the bottom of the record, it will tell you where the book is located
14:51:49 - Patron : Ok ,great thanks so someone in the King library can get it without requesting
14:52:28 - Stefanie Hilles : Yes. You could come to the library, get it off the shelf, and check it out at either one of the self-checkout stations or the circulation desk
14:52:43 - Patron : That is great, I was just curious because I wrote it haha.
14:52:51 - Stefanie Hilles : HAHAHAHAHAHA

15:00:24 - Patron : Thanks, I will be in touch with future reference requests. Miami King Library a top ranked resource for sure.
15:01:05 - Stefanie Hilles : Thank you so much!! We appreciate it :)
15:01:17 - Patron : What does the crowd index mean
15:01:24 - Patron : on the homepage
15:01:46 - Stefanie Hilles : That's how many people are at the library at any given time
15:01:56 - Stefanie Hilles : So people can judge how crowded things might be
15:02:22 - Patron : Oh that is a neat feature. Right now it would be quiet since summer. It says 5 percent.
15:03:06 - Stefanie Hilles : It gets into the red during finals but summers are pretty slow, for sure
15:03:19 - Stefanie Hilles : That's when all us librarians catch up on everything haha
15:03:47 - Patron : Great thanks for all the information. You are like that Shoeshiner character in Police Squad TV sitcom who used to give Leslie Nielsen all the tips to break cases.
15:04:32 - Stefanie Hilles : Amazing! I always tell my students that if I wasn't a librarian I would be a detective because my favorite thing is finding stuff.
15:05:30 - Patron : Like  Sherlock Holmes, Oolombo, or Monk. All of which I bet are in the library.
15:06:01 - Stefanie Hilles : As they should be! When in doubt, go to the library! I think that's a Stephen King quote haha
15:06:37 - Patron : Good line, student research papers are like detective work, their chance to break a case in something.
15:06:47 - Stefanie Hilles : Exactly!
15:07:55 - Patron : I need to tell some students these good lines haha. Thanks for all the help.
15:08:16 - Stefanie Hilles : Of course! Happy to help. I got to find things!
15:08:34 - Stefanie Hilles : Have a great day. We are here until 5 if you need anything else!
15:09:44 - Patron : Thanks good to know because I am like Colombo saying  ""One More Thing"" haha
15:10:02 - Stefanie Hilles : I am going to have to watch some Colombo this weekend now!
15:11:18 - Patron : Yes,  there is one where he goes to college, You want students to ask questions.
15:12:14 - Stefanie Hilles : Perfect! That will be the one I find. I would say look for but I always find it - assuming it is streaming somewhere
15:12:41 - Stefanie Hilles : Ok! I need to get going. My shift was over at 3. It has been wonderful chatting with you!

15:43:00 - Patron : Yeah, definitely. It's for SPIE (Society of Photographic Instrumentation Engineers)
15:43:56 - Jenny Presnell : so we would, maybe, subscribe to their publications -- I assume you hare just going through their website
15:44:01 - Jenny Presnell : ?

15:44:20 - Patron : I am just going through their website.
15:44:33 - Jenny Presnell : We don't subscribe that way

15:45:06 - Jenny Presnell : I can help you find out how to find articles or the titles of their publications
15:45:12 - Jenny Presnell : then we can go that route
15:46:30 - Patron : Ah. Okay. So, can I only request access to certain articles?
15:46:43 - Jenny Presnell : <a href=""https://spie.org/publications"" target=""_blank"">https://spie.org/publications</a>
15:46:51 - Jenny Presnell : we can look for those titles

15:47:47 - Jenny Presnell : handle a university login/from a university patron database
15:48:37 - Patron : Okay. I don't particularly have one title in mind; I was able to find what I needed while waiting for the chat to load. And I understand.
15:48:37 - Jenny Presnell : there may be away
15:48:46 - Jenny Presnell : you can pick one of the titles
15:49:12 - Jenny Presnell : actually I think they are subject areas

15:50:31 - Patron : If I understand correctly; I have to be looking for a specific article, journal, etc. and go looking for it on the library website, then request access to that article?
15:50:57 - Jenny Presnell : At the top of the page
15:51:12 - Jenny Presnell : there is a drop down box that says journals
15:51:25 - Jenny Presnell : then you can browse through a specific journal
15:51:27 - Jenny Presnell : otherwise
15:51:35 - Jenny Presnell : we'd need a topic to look at an index
15:53:19 - Patron : Okay.
15:57:46 - Patron : I'm sorry. I'm confused. Do you need to know what journal I'm looking at specifically?
16:01:00 - Jenny Presnell : Usually you don't go to a website of a professional society -- usually you use an index to many journals, search for a topic and then look at the journal articles that the database brings up
16:01:13 - Jenny Presnell : If you want thes specific journals
16:01:33 - Jenny Presnell : we can look to see if we subscribe to them and then you could do a keyword search in them
16:01:56 - Jenny Presnell : if you really want these journals from the website only, you will hae to look one by one
16:03:57 - Patron : The only one that I need to know about is the Journal of Biomedical Optics (JBO)

16:07:16 - Jenny Presnell : if you select that link
16:07:23 - Jenny Presnell : you should be able to search in the journal

10:40:19 - Patron : OK, many thanks. Yes, please include me on any messages regarding library use. My issue is that I rely on a public library in Dayton and it looks like they won't be live until October but I may still be able to use the UD library.
10:41:21 - Jenny Presnell : That is true. The connection to Search Ohio will be later per our head of tech services. (who happened to walk past while we are chatting)
10:41:31 - Jenny Presnell : You should be able to use UD
10:41:35 - Jenny Presnell : in the past
10:41:47 - Jenny Presnell : which doesn't always mean anything
10:42:16 - Jenny Presnell : you could send and return a book to any OL library -- didn't have to be associated with that library because
10:42:35 - Jenny Presnell : your record stayed with your home library, it was just a destination change
10:42:55 - Jenny Presnell : I'd call UD to make sure, but that is the agreement we have among OhioL libraries
10:43:01 - Jenny Presnell : I thing 
10:43:38 - Jenny Presnell : think the Search Ohio issues is systems talking to one another and will require some behind the scenes tech work
10:44:18 - Jenny Presnell : we have been working on this change for at least 18 mos. and everyone is most concerned with OhioLINK operating properly
10:47:51 - Patron : Thanks again. I'll see how things go next week. Signing off...

11:25:27 - Kristen Adams : This is not from an academic journal that's undergone peer review. It's a publication of the Georgia Historical Society.

It seems that this source, and perhaps news sources or information from one of our business databases would have that kind of info (and are great sources), but again those aren't the same as peer reviewed articles (if that's what your assignment is asking for).

13:07:50 - Patron : Another question - when I do the interlibrary loan. do I say that the article is in a book or a journal? When I put in book it asks for the name of the book and not the article within
13:08:54 - Patron : or dothey know by the page request
13:09:06 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Maybe it would be a better idea to request it as a journal then. You can put in ""The Oxford Handbook of Participation in Organizations"" for the journal title and ""chapter 13: Employee Share Ownership"" for the article title
13:09:34 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I don't think it's too big of a deal either way, as long as you share the information about the specific chapter you're requesting

The Ebsco interface itself changed after Finals Week in May so it might look different, too. Try that and let me know if you can see your folder.

15:34:23 - Patron : ok. thank you. I don't have what you showed me
15:40:21 - Jenny Presnell : We are 99% sure that this is one of the ebooks that was added accidentally even though we no longer have access. Just about all of the librarians/people who could verify that are at a national conference. We are working on this, but I believe that the ebooks we still have access to would connect with no problem
15:43:44 - Patron : ok. Thank you. Did you just remove access because before the switch I was able to get it through ebsco Host or whatever its called
15:45:18 - Jenny Presnell : We had to cancel some of the ebook packages recently. Not sure of the timeline compared to the new system.
15:45:24 - Jenny Presnell : so
15:45:40 - Jenny Presnell : I would send in a comment -- I'm looking for the link to do so
15:46:10 - Patron : ok heres the link they sent me to get the book. <a href=""http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nlebk&amp;AN=860568&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nlebk&amp;AN=860568&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a> or login into MyEBSCOhost

I can check. What is her name and what was the program?

13:55:10 - Ginny Boehme : Ok, we do have it listed in the catalog but we don't have a print version. What's listed is an electronic version. It should be easy for you to access, but if you are not currently affiliated with Miami then you will have to come in person to read and download/print. Once on campus, it should be viewable through the ""View Online"" link on the catalog entry page: <a href=""https://ohiolink-mu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OHIOLINK_MU/mjrtap/cdi_proquest_journals_304608664"" target=""_blank"">https://ohiolink-mu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OHIOLINK_MU/mjrtap/cdi_proquest_journals_304608664</a>

13:59:35 - Patron : I think so.  We currenlty live in Alexandria, Virginia, so getting there is an issue.  However, I am traveling to that area of the country in September, so I might be able to visit the campus then.  Is there a way for me to make a copy there?  I am sure this is not possible, but I will ask anyway:  Is there a way I could obtain a electronic copy of the thesis?
14:01:38 - Ginny Boehme : Yes, you can get an electronic copy quite easily if you are able to make it to campus. We have free access to the electronic version, but only for currently affiliated patrons or those accessing from on campus. If you have a local university or college that you are affiliated with, you may also be able to ask them if they can obtain a copy for you through Interlibrary Loan. 
14:02:06 - Ginny Boehme : If you are able to visit the campus, that would probably be easiest

If so you might give them a call to ask if they have access to an online version of the latest edition. Their phone is 513-785-3235. If it is through Oxford the main desk here might have some info at 513-529-4141. This was not something you had to purchase through e-campus bookstore, though?
12:59:04 - Patron : I can also use the 5th one they just said there was avalibites online
13:00:30 - Barry Zaslow : The 5th eds look to be all in print at Hamilton but if you want to double check with them first I'd try calling--just might save you some time if they do know more about this. We just changed the whole library system for all the schools in Ohio last Monday and it's quite confusing.

I can try. We are all having challenges since we just changed statewide a week ago. Do you have some specific articles or just a subject you are trying to research?
14:11:51 - Patron : I am working on my comprehensive exam for my Ed.d  - specifically for a section on disproportionality in suspension rates.  the article I am looking for right now is from Coles and Powell - A BlackCrit analysis on black urban youth and suspension disproportionality as anti-black symbolic violence

14:12:53 - Barry Zaslow : Also we had subscriptions to many Taylor &amp; Francis publications that were cancelled because they raised their prices well over the cost of inflation. If we don't have access we can try to get you the article(s) on Interlibrary Loan.
14:13:10 - Barry Zaslow : Let me see what I can find for the Coles &amp; Powell. Please hold on.
14:14:30 - Patron : Here's another one I have been trying to get: Race Is Not Neutral: A National Investigation of African American and Latino Disproportionality in School Discipline  -- when I look it up on the library website it says get PDF, then brings me to a page that says I don't have access

If you haven't used this service you create a new account with your unique ID/password, put in request, ""article"" and fill in the boxes with your citation. The staff will try to find it at another school and get a scan sent to your e-mail with a a link.
14:28:20 - Barry Zaslow : I went to Google Scholar first and then found the journal year, issue, etc. but you are not doing anything wrong. There are a lot of false positives/negatives in the system right now that need sorted out

14:30:55 - Barry Zaslow : If that doesn't work try Interlibrary Loan for that as well. It let me download it to my desktop but I'm signed on at King as a staff member (not sure if that makes a difference)
14:31:36 - Patron : Got it, Thanks!   In the past if I couldn't find something I just moved on, would you recommend this chat as the best way to get help?  I don't want to bother anyone, but you sure have been helpful!

You could try King Circulation first at 513-529-4141 in case he or Kris Abney who is the other supervisor are around.
14:21:57 - Patron : I previously tried  King Circulation. They, or at least the person who fielded the call, didn't have a clue. Does Mr. Withers have a clue?
14:25:05 - Barry Zaslow : He or Kris are likely the people who will ""have a clue"" but since the entire state changed over to this new system within the past few weeks there are a lot of challenges. I'm sorry about this runaround. Kris' email is abneykl@miamioh.edu if you want to include both of them

10:06:09 - Katie Gibson : The new system is not set up that way, unfortunately. It's not two separate catalogs, but rather two ""zones"" in the shared system. 
10:06:28 - Patron : So I must sign in first?

10:07:55 - Katie Gibson : That's another issue that has been reported and is getting fixed.
10:08:34 - Patron : Okay, thanks! I've not seen that. I liked having both buttons there to allow me to choose one or the other database, and not having to sign in until I was ready to order a book.

13:13:25 - Patron : I have checked out some Ohio Link items, and I believe I was told they all need to be back by July 5th.
13:14:30 - Patron : It appears that the library is closed this weekend, so I am just checking to see what is the best thing for me to do when it comes to these items. I am actively using them, and hope to keep them until the last possible second before returning them.
13:14:55 - Jaclyn Spraetz : You can go to your library account on the library website to see if you can renew them
13:15:00 - Patron : When I look at MyAccount, I am unable to find the specific details regarding these items, so simply reaching out to inquire further.
13:15:06 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Oh I see
13:15:26 - Patron : May have something to do with the service transition that has taken place this summer.
13:15:55 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Yes, that definitely is probably the case! The circulation department can help you with this. You can call their number at (513) 529-4141
13:16:23 - Jaclyn Spraetz : They will be able to answer your questions about renewing your books and addressing your concern about the library being closed this weekend
13:16:32 - Patron : Okay. I will see what I can do. I have called without an answer twice before starting the chat feature.
13:16:47 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Let me grab a different contact for you then. Hold on just a moment
13:17:09 - Patron : I'll hold for a bit and can attempt a call before close later today. I don't want to be any trouble for you.
13:17:38 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Kris Abney is a really helpful person to talk to. Her number is (513) 529-2434 and her email is abneykl@miamioh.edu

11:07:58 - Jaclyn Spraetz : This might take me a little more time to find. Do you mind sharing your email address with me so I can get back to you?
11:09:23 - Patron : Certainly. tednchristian@gmail.com
11:09:37 - Jaclyn Spraetz : One thing you can do is request this through interlibrary loan. Here is the link: <a href=""https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html"" target=""_blank"">https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html</a>
11:09:48 - Jaclyn Spraetz : If I find another option I will reach out to you through email! 
11:10:16 - Patron : Would interlibrary loan work through my local branch of the Cincinnati Hamilton County Public Library?
11:11:00 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Yes, I believe they will be able to help you with this!
11:11:09 - Jaclyn Spraetz : They also do interlibrary loans
11:11:12 - Patron : Great, thank you so much.

We serve a variety of students both professionally and academically. We want to empower our members in a different way this semester. This semester our goal is to show that ""Your background doesn’t determine your future—your mindset, your work ethic, and your belief in your own worth do."" We want to watch a film this academic year with our members The Pursuit of Happyness, The Great Debaters, and or Coach Carter. 

Are there any grants or programs that the library may have so that we can watch this moving with our members?","","15","","12:28:06 - Laura Birkenhauer : Hello! One moment while I look into some options for this. 
12:28:17 - Patron : Thank you!
12:34:01 - Laura Birkenhauer : So, I wanted to go ahead and check and see if we had any of these movies available. I do see that The Great Debaters is available through SWANK (one of our databases) through 8/31/2025: <a href=""https://digitalcampus.swankmp.net/muo369164/watch/D76BE665BCDDBD65?referrer=direct"" target=""_blank"">https://digitalcampus.swankmp.net/muo369164/watch/D76BE665BCDDBD65?referrer=direct</a> But, I'm not sure if that works on the timeline that you have in mind. A good person to contact about making available other films through the library would be Carla Myers, who you can reach out to at <a href=""mailto:myersc2@maimioh.edu"">myersc2@miamioh.edu</a> 
12:36:27 - Patron : Okay, I will reach out to Carla Myers. That does not work on the timeline I had in mind but did the other films happen to be on SWANK? Are grants or programs available through the library for these type of incentives?
12:39:51 - Laura Birkenhauer : Unfortunately, no. I checked both SWANK and Kanopy - two of our steaming video platforms - and the other videos aren't in either. You can access those databases here if you wanted to check into other available content. We do purchase streaming video for classes often, so we may be able to purchase one of these through that process - which is why I've directed you to Carla. We don't have any other grants or programs that I can direct you to, though, I'm sorry!
12:40:02 - Laura Birkenhauer : Here's that link: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/az/databases"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/az/databases</a>
12:42:28 - Patron : Hi Laura,

Thank you so much for your help! I saw that Carla is currently out of the office until Monday. I don’t mind waiting at all, but I just wanted to check—is there anyone else I might be able to reach out to in the meantime, or would it be best to wait for her return?
I appreciate your guidance either way!
12:43:50 - Laura Birkenhauer : It would definitely be best to wait for her return. She is the only staff member that can handle these kinds of requests here in Oxford. I'd recommend reaching out to her by email now, and she'll respond as soon as she receives your message!
12:45:22 - Patron : Hi Laura,

Thank you again for your help—I’ve gone ahead and emailed Carla.

I apologize, but I’m a bit unfamiliar with navigating the SWANK database. Should I search for the specific movie titles directly using the search bar, or is it better to type in “films” or browse through categories? I appreciate your patience and guidance!
12:46:01 - Patron : *navigating the database in general
12:46:03 - Laura Birkenhauer : This is the link to SWANK - you can search film titles directly in the search bar <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/SWANK"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/SWANK</a>
12:46:31 - Laura Birkenhauer : And here's the link to Kanopy - you can use the magnifying glass at the top to search by title, too <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/kanopy"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/kanopy</a>
12:47:28 - Laura Birkenhauer : Finally, here are links to ALL of our databases with video (but the two I just sent are the ones that have more popular films): <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/az/databases?t=20574"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/az/databases?t=20574</a>

Out of curiosity, is it possible for me to be provided a copy at library? I understand there would be a cost.
12:49:03 - Abigail Morgan : We usually don't make copies ourselves but we have machines called KIC scanners that anyone can use that make it pretty easy to create a digital file from a physical book. 
12:49:20 - Abigail Morgan : The KIC machines are free
12:50:57 - Patron : Got it. You actually answered my next question on whether it had been digitized. So if I were to come to use the scanner, is there a specific place I would need to go? And also, could it be “checked out” (apologies if that’s not the correct term) to me, even though I am not affiliated with Miami?

12:55:48 - Abigail Morgan : The wait time if there is one should not be long. I recommend calling the circulation desk because they will know much more about exact details. The number is 513-529-4141
12:56:37 - Abigail Morgan : It might be worth trying to ILL the dissertation through an academic library in New Orleans if you can't make it up here

15:44:26 - Patron : Hi Katie!
15:44:42 - Katie Gibson : This is a known problem that we're having with the new catalog 
15:44:55 - Katie Gibson : it's showing things we don't actually have access too in electronically
15:44:59 - Katie Gibson : I'll take a look at this
15:46:43 - Patron : Thanks
15:48:47 - Katie Gibson : Ok, it looks like all of our online subscriptions have a 3 year embargo. You can still request it through interlibrary loan however: <a href=""https://lib.miamioh.edu/use/borrow/ill/"" target=""_blank"">https://lib.miamioh.edu/use/borrow/ill/</a>
15:50:37 - Patron : Did Miami change the online subscription services?
15:51:30 - Katie Gibson : We changed the back end system that runs the catalog, check out, etc. but not the subscriptions themselves.
15:52:14 - Katie Gibson : But when the new system went live, some of the records from the big aggregator collections (that we don't have access to all of their content) got turned on
15:52:21 - Katie Gibson : so I thought this might be one of those.
15:52:35 - Patron : I'm trying to request the article, but it seems that there isn't an online option.
15:52:52 - Katie Gibson : But this is something we have, but the publisher doesn't put the most recent 3 years in the databases
15:53:21 - Katie Gibson : You should be able to request it through Interlibrary loan... just fill out the ""new article request"" form here: <a href=""https://lib.miamioh.edu/use/borrow/ill/"" target=""_blank"">https://lib.miamioh.edu/use/borrow/ill/</a>
15:57:43 - Patron : Will a PDF be sent to me via email?  Although I work for Oxford, I listed Hamilton as the campus because I live closer to Hamilton.
15:58:24 - Katie Gibson : Yes, you'll get an email when the article is available with a link back in to the ILL system where you can download the a .pdf
15:58:43 - Patron : Thanks so much for your help Katie!
15:58:59 - Katie Gibson : you're welcome
15:59:20 - Patron : Do you know how long this typically takes?
15:59:55 - Katie Gibson : I've been requesting a lot recently. It's usually 3-5 days, but it depends on how fast an owning library gets a scan to us
16:00:23 - Patron : Thanks again and have a nice afternoon:)
16:00:30 - Katie Gibson : you too

I took ""Social Psychology in Sport"" as an Elective for my Fall Semester, as I believe Physiology and Psychology are intertwined.

A few days ago, my assigned Professor for the said subject sent an email to acquire the Book necessary for the Fall Semester - Social Psychology in Sports by Louise Davis.

Unfortunately, King Library and Lane Library do NOT have this specific book, and the Book costs $175 (which is quite a sum for me currently).
I was wondering if I can meet a Librarian tomorrow, to help me with resources, where I can either borrow or download this Book from.

Sorry if this seems like a RANDOM text, but I saw a notification on the Website informing me that a Librarian is online. Hence, reaching out !!","","22","","17:23:57 - Katie Gibson : Hello

12:49:17 - Patron : Hi Ginny!
12:49:23 - Patron : I hope you're having a good summer!
12:50:23 - Ginny Boehme : Thanks, you too! We switched to a new system a couple of weeks ago, and we are running into this question a lot. The vendor of the new system is ProQuest so it prioritizes those records. If we have access to something, scroll down a bit further on the item record and look for the links under ""View Online""
12:50:52 - Ginny Boehme : Most of the time for articles, if we have access, you'll be able to get to the PDF from one of those links
12:51:06 - Ginny Boehme : (Not working the best for e-books right now though)
12:52:23 - Patron : Okay let me try it and make sure I'm going it correctly. Also trying to figure out this new library search system...
12:53:07 - Ginny Boehme : We are in the same boat. I'm happy to double-check anything if you like as well
12:53:54 - Patron : Here's an example article title: The Development of Social Capital Through International Students' Involvement in Campus Organizations
12:54:17 - Patron : I search for that and my only option is ProQuest. I click to go to that site and it says ""I might have access."" Do I need to log into their site to access it?
12:56:58 - Ginny Boehme : This looks to be an actual bug. I'm seeing two entries for this one, and one of them says it's open access but the link appears to be broken. If you find other OA things like this, best option is to search with google or another search engine. I found the journal page where you can get this article: <a href=""https://ojed.org/jis/article/view/52"" target=""_blank"">https://ojed.org/jis/article/view/52</a>
12:57:15 - Ginny Boehme : I'll report this issue
12:59:22 - Patron : It sounds like if it's OA, I should try to search on Google if ProQuest is my only option. I don't want to submit a bunch of requests for ILL so trying to avoid that route unless I have to. If it's not OA, then I may need to do ILL if ProQuest is my only option?
13:00:09 - Ginny Boehme : Basically, yes
13:00:44 - Ginny Boehme : We do have some things through ProQuest, but likely not much in your field
13:01:03 - Patron : Here's another one: Academic burnout and student engagement: a moderated mediation model of internal locus of control and loneliness
13:01:24 - Patron : It has Ebsco as an option, but then when I go there, it says no such item exists.
13:02:23 - Ginny Boehme : It's possible this is from a journal we cancelled recently
13:02:44 - Ginny Boehme : The cancellation data hasn't trickled its way through all systems yet
13:02:57 - Ginny Boehme : ILL seems to be the way to go here
13:03:26 - Patron : Okay thank you!
13:03:36 - Ginny Boehme : You're welcome!
13:04:02 - Patron : I wondered why I was getting so many ProQuest links - that explains a lot that they own the site or search engine or whatever
13:04:43 - Ginny Boehme : Yeah, it's frustrating. Our tech folks are trying to get it to stop doing that for things we don't have, but it's a work in progress
13:05:02 - Patron : Thanks for clarifying! I appreciate your help!

16:55:50 - Stefanie Hilles : So, you requested them through interlibrary loan?

This is for a course I am teaching in the fall.  The primary sources could come from any part of the world, as long as they are accessible to students (in English) and were created after 1945.","","12","","17:12:56 - Mark Dahlquist : Hi thanks for this question, I'll be glad to help with this.
17:13:21 - Mark Dahlquist : Hold on for one moment please while I look for some resources.
17:15:07 - Mark Dahlquist : We have a few research guides that might be relevant to this topic, such as the guide to history, historical primary sources, and the guide to newspapers. I will share these below as one starting point.
17:15:21 - Mark Dahlquist : History: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/history"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/history</a>
17:15:33 - Mark Dahlquist : Historical Primary Sources: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/c.php?g=22138&amp;p=130438"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/c.php?g=22138&amp;p=130438</a>
17:15:53 - Mark Dahlquist : Newspapers: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/newspapers"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/newspapers</a>
17:16:41 - Mark Dahlquist : These guides will pull together a range of historical primary sources that may be of interest.
17:17:43 - Mark Dahlquist : We also have extensive resources on WWII in our special collections, as indicated for example in this record: <a href=""https://archivesspace.lib.miamioh.edu/subjects/508"" target=""_blank"">https://archivesspace.lib.miamioh.edu/subjects/508</a>
17:19:06 - Mark Dahlquist : Are you interested in more recent primary sources?
17:20:01 - Mark Dahlquist : You might also try searching Miami's digital special collections, here: <a href=""https://digital.lib.miamioh.edu/"" target=""_blank"">https://digital.lib.miamioh.edu/</a>
17:24:06 - Mark Dahlquist : I hope these resources provide a useful starting point! Feel free to contact us again or to reach out in particular to History Librarian Jenny Presnell (presnejl@miamioh.edu) or to our special collections librarians about our holdings in this area.
17:25:36 - Mark Dahlquist : Thanks again for this inquiry, and have a great evening.

12:49:29 - Stefanie Hilles : Ok. I heard back. Unfortunately, no. There is nothing we can do as the air handler on that side of the building is offline for maintenance until Aug 8th. The study rooms on the opposite end on the first floor all still have air conditioning

10:31:39 - Patron : Did something change in the way we can access articles from key publishers? I remember we had the google scholar search embedded in the library.
10:34:21 - Roger Justus : There has been a change in the back-end provider for the library's search page and search engine (along with all Ohio Libraries), and the Google Scholar link was not provided in the new systems.  You can still access that at their URL - <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/"" target=""_blank"">https://scholar.google.com/</a> and have access to Miami University items.
10:39:04 - Patron : Well, the article I am looking for is published in 2022 in one of the top 5 entrepreneurship journals - IMO this should be online available, but it isn't. If I search via google scholar I am not getting the same access as before. Having to do a formal request is just not very user friendly. I appreciate if you could give this feedback forward. I am overseas on research work and it's slowing me down considerably.

I'm currently taking MAC 309, Advertising and Consumer Culture. I was wondering if I could get help navigating some research for an assignment. Currently, I'm working on a report about the demographics and psychographics of consumers for American Girl dolls. I've tried using Mintel, MRI-Simmons, and SimplyAnalytics, but I haven't been able to find anything. I'm not sure if I'm just not using the resources correctly, or if there's really nothing to find on there. My professor said that I can resort to news articles and academic journals if need be, but she really wants us to include statistics in our papers if possible. Do you have any recommendations for how to proceed?

Thank you so much, 

Sophia Goldberg","","8","","16:37:44 - Stefanie Hilles : Hi Sophia! My gut reaction is that perhaps American Girl Dolls are too specific? That said, I am the art librarian so business databases aren't my strong suit. Have you contacted Abi Morgan our business librarian? 
16:39:23 - Patron : That was my next move. I thought I'd try out the library chat first. I think it's too specific to find things for as well, but my professor really wants stats from these databases for that specific brand, so I need to exhaust all my options before trying something else.
16:40:29 - Stefanie Hilles : If you want to stick around, I am happy to dive in and see if I can find anything. Abi will definitely be faster than me however, haha
16:41:13 - Patron : I'll go ahead and send her an email. Thank you so much for your help!
16:41:39 - Stefanie Hilles : You're welcome! Sorry I couldn't be of more assistance.
16:41:53 - Patron : No worries, it's a very specific topic.
16:42:37 - Stefanie Hilles : From my experience growing up in the 80s and 90s, I would say that the demographic was the rich girls. If that helps, haha

13:47:14 - Ginny Boehme : Ok let me see if we might have access through other resources
13:50:42 - Patron : journal of science teacher education - nothing available after 2016 or 2019
13:51:06 - Ginny Boehme : Bad news for these, and possibly others: these journals are both published by Taylor and Francis, and I know that we have had issues with price hikes from them that have resulted in subscription cancellations. I'm guessing these got caught up in that
13:51:32 - Ginny Boehme : Similar thing for the last one
13:51:46 - Patron : journal of research in science teaching
13:51:52 - Patron : these are my biggest journals
13:52:05 - Patron : well how will I stay up to date?
13:52:16 - Patron : about my field i mean
13:53:06 - Ginny Boehme : We should still be able to get you articles from these, you will just have to request them through Interlibrary Loan. You should have access to the Tables of Contents through the journals' websites, which should allow you to read the abstracts and decide which article(s) you want to request
13:53:28 - Ginny Boehme : That is the best we can do, I'm sorry
13:54:05 - Patron : Ginny - I know how to find out about the articles. But in 2025 waiting for an article to show up to conduct research sounds ridiculous at this time
13:54:43 - Ginny Boehme : I understand but we have a flat budget and can't afford to maintain all of our subscriptions every year
13:54:53 - Patron : I know it is not your fault but this is really an inconvenice. I am sorry you are caught in the middle
13:55:16 - Ginny Boehme : I am too, and I'm sorry for the inconvenience
13:55:23 - Patron : I am curious why all science education ones are cut though. is it the same for all other fields
13:55:36 - Patron : these are the tops journals in our field
13:55:46 - Ginny Boehme : It is definitely the same across all disciplines

One moment while I look into this. 
14:32:10 - Laura Birkenhauer : It doesn't look like we have access to that edition, either as a print book or ebook. I'm sorry! We can try to place an interlibrary loan, but often libraries do not load textbooks.

14:34:53 - Patron : Ok, and I have another question. Can I borrow pdf from a book that I just want to enjoy from this website or what is this website for?
14:36:50 - Laura Birkenhauer : With the library's website (https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/), you can search for availability of materials in our collection using the Search box in the middle of the homepage that says ""Start Your Research Here..."" We won't always have an available PDF, ebook, or other digital format for items. Sometimes, we'll only have materials in print, and our website will list the physical location of the item. Does that make sense?

17:29:05 - Patron : It really is!!!! I found one from 2010 that mentioned 33....but that was so old I didn't wan to use it. Yes, you would think it would be published in some periodical regarding philanthropy!
17:29:24 - Stefanie Hilles : Or some stats somewhere!
17:31:18 - Patron : I think I have what I need for now. I appreciate your help!!!
17:32:06 - Stefanie Hilles : Are you sure? I can keep looking if you want. Or maybe contact Abi Morgan, the business librarian? Maybe those stats are somewhere in her databases?
17:35:42 - Patron : If an answer can be found, that would be ideal! I sent a note to my colleague who asked to find the answer, mentioning the 140ish universities with $1B or higher endowments and was waiting to hear if he wanted more info or if that ballpark was enough. If you have time that would be great but I also understand if you have other items to review!
17:36:12 - Stefanie Hilles : If you give me your email, I will keep digging. I hate not finding things.
17:36:22 - Patron : sounds great! chernisl@miamioh.edu
17:36:44 - Stefanie Hilles : Awesome! I will keep looking for a little while longer and, if I find anything, I will let you know!
17:36:54 - Patron : thank you so much!
17:36:59 - Stefanie Hilles : You're welcome!
17:37:00 - Patron : have a good evening :)
17:37:16 - Stefanie Hilles : You too! And may your next research question be easier to answer :)
17:38:15 - Patron : LOL!

IOAP and society discounts may be combined with other available discounts;

another type of discount, please contact the Nutrients Editorial Office as
soon as possible.

Open Access accelerates research discovery and offers broader opportunities
for the adoption of research findings. APCs enable us to peer review,
publish, index, and permanently maintain published articles. APCs are only
charged to accepted papers after full peer review. Article acceptances can
only be made by independent editorial board members and cannot be made by
MDPI staff. We thank you for paying an APC to support Open Access.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation. I look forward to hearing from you.

13:02:34 - Patron : Dayton
13:02:55 - Patron : So if I requested it through the Metro library, that's all that is needed?
13:03:15 - Patron : Or the UD library

13:12:43 - Patron : Yeah, that's what I figured but I've been unsuccessful in getting responses, so I've broadened the scope of my inquiry.
13:13:26 - Patron : But the thesis may be what I need, so I'll save this conversation for later action with a local library. Thanks for your time and knowledge!

15:56:43 - Barry Zaslow : Good to have that info. Let me see what's going on.
15:57:16 - Patron : i got signed in but i just dont know how to open the book to actually read it
16:00:03 - Patron : it says it is placed on reserve in the king library... i am not sure what that means
16:00:06 - Barry Zaslow : That title is a print copy of a book on reserve at King Library. If you need to read it come to the front desk and ask for it by author/title and the class (ITS 201). The library is open now from 7am-1am every day except for the holiday weekend. Does this make sense? There are some older editions online but not the 2022
16:00:48 - Patron : oh ok! so i just come to the king library and ask for this edition and i get a physical copy?
16:01:19 - Barry Zaslow : Right. It's a limited loan usually two hours in the building which you might be able to keep longer if no one else has asked for it the same time.
16:02:01 - Patron : sounds good. thank you. is this the only way to access the textbook (by loaning it out from the king library?)
16:03:33 - Barry Zaslow : In this case yes, unless you purchase one from e-campus bookstore or another vendor.  Amazon lists a paper copy around $30 (the hardback is much more at $180)
16:04:08 - Patron : thank you!
16:04:52 - Barry Zaslow : You're welcome. Have a good rest of the day and best wishes with ITS. Dr. Toops was a wonderful colleague who sadly passed a few years ago just after retiring.
16:07:41 - Patron : Thank you so much. and that is so heartbreaking to hear, may they rest in peace.

16:59:40 - Barry Zaslow : OK. We do have subscriptions to New York Times and Wall Street Journal that are part of the library's budget so you don't have to pay for them. If you go to Databases A-Z you can find directions for this under N and/or W.  These might give some info. We also have some other ways to access things such as Newsbank under Databases A-Z or doing a search for ""technology"" in that list and try some 
17:00:37 - Patron : ah, newsbank!
17:01:50 - Barry Zaslow : I would also recommend reaching out to Roger Justus and Nate Floyd, two of our librarians who keep up with current trends in a lot of areas. They might have some ideas. Hardly anyone is here Sunday but they should be around during the week: justusra@miamioh.edu or floydns@miamioh.ed
17:01:54 - Barry Zaslow : edu that is 
17:01:54 - Patron : newspapers don't necessarily give meaty stories on tech like announcements from Anthropic or OpenAI
17:02:29 - Patron : i'll check all mthat out. Thanks Barry!
17:03:30 - Barry Zaslow : You're welcome. Sorry not to have much concrete info. This is a bit beyond my wheelhouse being a humanities librarian without any social media or tech expertise myself
17:04:11 - Patron : no worries. you've been a great help! hope you have  great rest of your sunday
17:04:18 - Barry Zaslow : You too

Specifically, I am looking for an article I read a few moments ago that highlighted the benefits of both. One aspect was that practitioners could learn how to theorize and approach practice improvements from faculty (even if they have never taught K-12), in turn, Faculty could learn from practitioners how theory conflicts with practice in many instances and value experiential knowledge that is flexible to changing dynamics in schools, which research often lags.","","16","","09:50:18 - Kristen Adams : Hello

09:56:02 - Kristen Adams : I used 'higher education' AND 'theory' AND 'practice', then limited to just articles
09:58:21 - Patron : Thanks, Kristen. This is a fascinating topic. I always believe that theory informs practice and practice informs theory--bidirectionally and reciprocally.
09:58:43 - Kristen Adams : Your welcome. I understand.
09:58:50 - Kristen Adams : Balance in all thing
09:59:03 - Kristen Adams : *things
10:01:10 - Patron : Yes. I quickly reviewed the articles. Are there any articles that highlight the conflict between K-12 veteran teachers and teacher education program preparation of new teachers? Or how teachers view research's influence on their pedagogical practice? Or how faculty who have not taught in K-12 school systems view their roles in teaching K-12 educators?
10:03:39 - Kristen Adams : Oh, I see. I misread, I though we were looking for higher education or college.

If you haven't yet used this service create an account with your unique ID/password, put in new request, book, and fill in the boxes with the citation.

14:05:16 - Barry Zaslow : It looks like our copy is checked out until Jan. 2026 and I did not see any in OhioLINK. You could try Interlibrary Loan here: <a href=""https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html"" target=""_blank"">https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html</a>
14:06:36 - Barry Zaslow : If you haven't yet used this service create an account with your unique ID/password, put in new request, book, and fill in the boxes with your citation. The staff will try to find it at a library outside Ohio and have it sent here. Since it looks like a textbook there's no guarantees anyone will have/lend it but it's worth a try. The loan period will probably be shorter than a semester, too. Does this make sense?
14:07:43 - Patron : Yes. Thanks for the support
14:08:43 - Barry Zaslow : You could also put a hold on our copy by stopping at a circulation desk but it would still only give you six weeks if the person did return it (not always a guarantee)
14:18:00 - Barry Zaslow : I'm going to close the chat window since it's been 10 minutes since we spoke. Best wishes for the rest of the day and beyond.

14:36:11 - Barry Zaslow : Good clarification. Earlier editions have a yellow flower! Anyway, we don't own the 2021 edition here but it looks like four OhioLINK schools have it (not sure if they are all still available). If you go to the library home page and search for the Campbell biology with Urry (she's the most recent editor) and limit to 2020 or more recent then OhioLINK you should be able to request one. Better to ""sign in"" before that if you are on your own device. Does this make sense?

14:39:46 - Barry Zaslow : I didn't see any online ones in Ohio or here; there is one available at Amazon but it's $95.

10:31:19 - Patron : I will keep looking for the other ones
10:31:45 - Andy Revelle : I would consider getting other editions from the library and telling the instructor that those editions are not available
10:33:00 - Andy Revelle : Also, contrary to popular belief, ISBN is not a reliable way to search.
10:33:04 - Patron : She mentioned in the Course expectations that she wants us to get the exact editions and that too in hard copy, no ebooks
10:33:33 - Andy Revelle : They change sometimes for no reason and sometimes the paperback and hardcover will have different ISBNs
10:33:49 - Patron : It honestly makes no sense to me to be buying copies that I would be using only for one class but she seemed rather stringent about it
10:34:09 - Andy Revelle : What would be more helpful would be the publisher and the publication year
10:34:36 - Patron : I see! She did provide with the publication year but no publisher
10:34:54 - Andy Revelle : What you gave me in the list is the original publication year. 
10:35:26 - Andy Revelle : The publication year for the editions that she wants you to have would help us find them
10:35:34 - Patron : What I gave to you is the exact list that she gave us
10:35:42 - Patron : I just copied it directly
10:36:10 - Andy Revelle : You're not the only person in the class unable to find those. I can assure you of that.
10:36:45 - Andy Revelle : Tell her that you asked a librarian. That I helped you find those two but we were unable to find the other via ISBN
10:37:13 - Patron : You mean other people in my class have reached out to you with the same queries?
10:37:31 - Andy Revelle : No. Just that if I can't find it they probably can't find it either
10:37:33 - Patron : Sure, I was trying to avoid this but I willl drop her an email
10:37:51 - Patron : Thank you so much for all the help!

18:17:01 - Barry Zaslow : Let me see what's up with this. Please hold on for a few minutes.
18:17:11 - Patron : ok
18:17:31 - Barry Zaslow : We just went to a new statewide system late June 2025 so everything is different and we are all learning.
18:18:08 - Patron : yes I see that...i have used and accessed the article in the past but now cant seem to figure it out
18:24:14 - Barry Zaslow : So it looks like this is in JSTOR but not a part that we have in our subscription. You can try Interlibrary Loan here: <a href=""https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html"" target=""_blank"">https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html</a>. If you have not yet used this service create an account with your unique ID/password, put in new request, article and your citation. The staff will try to find it at another school and scan it with a link to your e-mail. Does this sound useful? It might not take too long once they start on the process during the day tomorrow.
18:25:17 - Patron : So basically, Miami does not have access to Generations at all anymore?
18:30:59 - Barry Zaslow : It's misleading because it says we do have the JSTOR files from 1970s-2024 but none of the articles will ""open"" so I believe it's a false positive from the new system. There are many of these in a host of areas, unfortunately.
18:34:38 - Barry Zaslow : We did have this in print up to 2006 but your citation is eight years newer. That leads me to think it shouldn't be too hard to find somewhere else in academia.
18:35:29 - Barry Zaslow : When I said ""did have"" I meant it is still in our collections at the SW Depository, not that we discarded it. Bad choice of words there.
18:37:23 - Patron : OK I'll have to figure out a different approach...I have several articles from them throughout my course that work when I taught this last year; I'll have to find a different way for them to get to it electronically.
18:39:07 - Barry Zaslow : Is Megan your liaison librarian? You could reach out to her also to see if she has any ideas. She's gone home for the evening but should be around the rest of the week: jaskowma@miamioh.edu
18:39:47 - Patron : ok thanks
18:41:37 - Barry Zaslow : You're welcome. I hope this can be resolved without too much more annoyance.
18:57:43 - Barry Zaslow : Prof. Abbott: I'm going to close the chat window now as it's been 15 minutes since we shared.

And if it's possible to stack reservations for it through the rest of the semester? I'd assume not on the latter, but figured I'd ask anyway. Thanks!","","6","","10:50:26 - Megan Jaskowiak : Hello.
10:50:49 - Megan Jaskowiak : Let me check on this with the circulation staff.
10:50:55 - Patron : Sure thing, thank you!
10:53:14 - Megan Jaskowiak : They have unlimited checkouts. They cannot make a future booking if they have it already checked out. However, as soon as their 14 days are up they can make another booking.
10:59:17 - Patron : Great, thank you! I think that's all I needed.
10:59:29 - Megan Jaskowiak : Have a good day!

17:33:57 - Stefanie Hilles : No problem! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
17:35:58 - Patron : Yes there is a part in the request form that says ""not needed after"" and then right under ""pickup date"" what does that mean?
17:38:20 - Stefanie Hilles : That's a great question! We have a new catalog and that is a new question for requesting books. Let me see what I can find out. That said, as long as you pick a date that's far out, like, idk, next year or something it should be fine. I don't think it really matters much. 
17:40:39 - Stefanie Hilles : Yeah. It's basically this confusing thing that I think we should just remove because it is silly, tbh. It's just the date where, if they didn't get the book to you by then, you wouldn't need it anymore and they should cross it off their list. But with books like this that I can guarantee we can get, it shouldn't be an issue. I would just put in some date in the future. Like spring semester or something.
17:41:22 - Patron : I see. Thank you very much for your help.
17:41:53 - Stefanie Hilles : Of course! That was a good question. I am happy to answer any others if you have them!
17:42:39 - Patron : I don't have any other question, thank you, have a good rest of your day.

12:33:11 - Patron : Thank you. Take your time.
12:46:17 - Laura Birkenhauer : In this case, I'm not finding anything online to indicate that an age range for readers has been designated for this book. Your best bet would be to contact the publisher directly, which you can do here: <a href=""https://idwpublishing.com/pages/contact"" target=""_blank"">https://idwpublishing.com/pages/contact</a> One ""clue"" I looked at were the subjects used to describe the book (seen here in WorldCat, <a href=""https://search.worldcat.org/title/1121264239)"" target=""_blank"">https://search.worldcat.org/title/1121264239)</a> - none of the subjects in that lengthy list indicate a younger audience. 
12:46:54 - Laura Birkenhauer : If you can get your hands on the book, sometimes you'll see something on the cover - inside or outside - to indicate the suggested age range for readers
12:47:42 - Laura Birkenhauer : Another ""clue"" I'm looking at is where it's been shelved in public libraries
12:48:00 - Laura Birkenhauer : I'm seeing that it's been shelved in adult sections, for example: <a href=""https://libcat.arlingtonva.us/Search/Results?lookfor=1121264239"" target=""_blank"">https://libcat.arlingtonva.us/Search/Results?lookfor=1121264239</a>

14:09:40 - Laura Birkenhauer : One moment while I look into this. 
14:14:50 - Laura Birkenhauer : Has you professor stated that the library has access for students to this film? Because I am unfortunately not finding that we do. We have a DVD here, which of course you cannot access from Luxembourg.

There is a way your professor could reach out to the library and request that our DVD is digitized for students in your class to watch it. Completing the form linked here <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/reserves-textbooks/StreamingVideoAndRemoteInstruction"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/reserves-textbooks/StreamingVideoAndRemoteInstruction</a> or contacting Carla Myers at myersc2@miamioh.edu is how they can get this process started.
14:15:04 - Laura Birkenhauer : I'll also check and see if I can find it streaming anywhere outside of the library. 
14:16:31 - Laura Birkenhauer : It looks like the Pianist is avaialble from a number of streaming services: <a href=""https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-pianist"" target=""_blank"">https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-pianist</a>
14:16:56 - Laura Birkenhauer : (Please note: Kanopy is listed there, but doesn't look like our access includes it.) 
14:16:58 - Patron : I will ask Veronica Horwath about that--but can complete the forms.  In a recent email from her - she wrote ""everyone streams Polanski's The Pianist before departure (for the study tour--and there are several for WW II).
14:17:22 - Laura Birkenhauer : Fawesome.tv is one of the options and looks like it's there for free

14:17:30 - Patron : Thanks for looking into it.  I assumed it was on Kanopy.  That's what I get for assuming.
14:17:59 - Laura Birkenhauer : You're welcome! I hope this gives you a few options to work with!
14:18:09 - Patron : The fawesome link apparently doesn't work in Lux.
14:19:03 - Laura Birkenhauer : Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. You could try clicking on the link from the Just Watch page I sent earlier to see if that helps at all <a href=""https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-pianist"" target=""_blank"">https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-pianist</a>
14:20:46 - Laura Birkenhauer : Prime Video lists it as ""Free with ads"" but I assume you'd need to subscribe to Prime? Plex, Fandango at Home, the Roku Channel, and Crunchyroll are all also listed as free options on Just Watch. I hope one of those works! I do think your professor should complete the form, though, so everyone can get access.

11:45:10 - Patron : Thank you for your help
11:49:13 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I do not see that we have this book. I am also not seeing it in OhioLINK. Is this something you need for your research? I would be happy to look into purchasing this
11:49:47 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Another option is to request it through interlibrary loan. Here is the link: <a href=""https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/use/borrow/ill/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/use/borrow/ill/</a>
11:50:06 - Patron : I am working on a grant proposal, and Chapters 1-5 seem quite relevant.
11:50:34 - Patron : Can we order individual chapters through ILL?
11:51:38 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Okay, that's helpful, thank you. You can always try to request a specific chapter. Sometimes we can get a copy of a chapter to send you you as a PDF
11:52:11 - Jaclyn Spraetz : ILL will get back to you very quickly to let you know if this is something that can't be requested. However, it is possible to ILL specific book chapters
11:53:08 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I am happy to look into purchasing this as well. E-books tend to get processed pretty quickly
11:54:20 - Patron : Either option is great. I am putting in the ILL request now. If a purchase option is available for these specific chapters would make the process quicker, I would be quite appreciative as well.
11:55:28 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Okay, sounds good! It might be easier to request the book chapter as a journal so that you can include the article title and journal title. I will also look into purchasing. Do you mind sharing your email with me so I can stay in contact with you? 
11:55:45 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Sorry book title
11:55:47 - Patron : megahefm@miamioh.edu
11:55:52 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Thank you! 
11:56:24 - Patron : Thank you so much for your help. I will follow your recommendation on requesting it as a journal paper.
11:56:44 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Great! Let me know if you have any questions or concerns! My email is spraetj@miamioh.edu
11:56:55 - Patron : Perfect. Have a great day

So. . .help??","","10","","12:28:55 - Barry Zaslow : Prof. Conn: Let me see what's going on with this. Please hold on.
12:29:24 - Patron : PS. I would prefer an online version but at this rate I'll take the old bound volumes.
12:30:07 - Barry Zaslow : Good to know. I was helping someone else and now should be able to direct my attention here.
12:34:41 - Barry Zaslow : Can you get to Journal Finder on the home page? It's just below the big search box in the middle with a blue link. If you put ""farm journal"" you get the information that there are print issues at the SW Depository which are usually requestable and some online issues in Hathi Trust. Usually these titles with common words work better in quotes. I think you are aware of our switch to a new system for all of Ohio in late June so things are a bit muddled. Does this help?
12:36:35 - Patron : Alas. . .no. I've done that already and the first item that pops up is indeed the journal I'm looking for. However, the record says ""c1956-"" and I'm looking for 1951 and 1955 issues.
12:38:58 - Barry Zaslow : You can try Interlibrary Loan for specific articles from those years. I doubt whether another institution will lend a bound volume of a journal but it's not unheard of so you might check with Sheila Sparks who coordinates ILL (sparkssk@miamioh.edu) to see if she could negotiate such a loan. It's worth a shot.
12:39:34 - Patron : So you're not seeing any digitized version of the journal either?
12:43:55 - Barry Zaslow : Only those Hathi Trust ones which look to be much earlier (ca. 1901-1915). I tried the earlier title ""Farm journal and country gentleman"" as well and it brought up the same links.
12:44:10 - Patron : Sigh. Thanks Barry!
12:45:05 - Barry Zaslow : You're welcome. Don't hesitate to reach out to Sheila and/or do Interlibrary Loan. We've gotten much more obscure things from as far away as Australia sometimes...

You can contact the front desk at King Library who can answer this question for you. Their phone number is (513) 529-4141
11:13:08 - Patron : Are you able to contact the front desk for me or put in an urgency for the book?
11:13:21 - Patron : I am currently not on campus and unable to make a phone call right now
11:13:55 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I can call them and ask for you. Just for more context to share with them, when did you request the textbook? 
11:14:19 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Also, what is your Miami username?
11:14:31 - Patron : I requested it yesterday but it deleted my request. So I just submitted another request. I can come pick it up today around 4:30pm
11:14:34 - Patron : weissa2
11:14:45 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Thank you! Hold on just a moment while I give them a call
11:15:00 - Jaclyn Spraetz : What is the title of the textbook? 
11:15:10 - Patron : Successful Reading Assessments and Interventions for Struggling Readers, 2012
11:15:17 - Patron : Jensen, D ; Tuten, J
11:18:06 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I just talked to someone at the front desk, and they have already pulled all of the holds for today, but it is located on the second floor on the library shelves. Here is the call number: LB1050.5 .J46 2012
11:18:19 - Jaclyn Spraetz : If you have a question about how to find this book, you can ask someone at the front desk to help you find it
11:19:06 - Patron : so they can not pull mine? I am confused, is the 2nd floor different from the other floors
11:21:15 - Jaclyn Spraetz : They pulled all the books for today already and did not see your request since it was put in so recently--requests are picked up behind the front desk. The next time staff will pull requests will be tomorrow morning. However, books are shelved in the stacks on the second floor of King Library and are available for students to pick up. So you can go to the shelf yourself to get the book and then check it out
11:21:21 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Does that make sense? 
11:22:27 - Patron : yes, I understand. I did not realize they only pull books once a day. Thank you

13:15:44 - Patron : right now, yes. any fun library search tips or tricks?
13:17:25 - Barry Zaslow : With the new system if you are looking for a specific thing and use the big search box it helps to put quotes around the title or subject or whatever so you don't get lots of unrelated keywords. Be sure to specify MU Libraries Search first and then expand later if no results otherwise you may be disappointed since the system is worldwide. Fortunately all the Ohio colleges/universities are connected (over 86 separate places)
13:18:21 - Patron : lovely, thats super useful. Thanks a ton!

19:59:16 - Patron : I think I see the problem, I downloaded it for the 17th instead of the 11th. There is a free trial that I can do
19:59:43 - Ginny Boehme : Oh yeah, that would probably be it. I didn't catch that

I am trying to find out the impact of inaccessible digital design so that I can come up with a solution. Is that something you can help with?","","12","","20:07:29 - Ginny Boehme : Hi there, can you tell me a little bit more about your topic and how you've tried to find info? Are you talking about accessibility from an ADA/visual disability standpoint?
20:09:57 - Patron : Yes, I have noticed from that some designers don't check that their designs meet accessibility requirements for people with visual impairments for example. So i am trying to find the effects or impact of that on people in that community so i can best analyze how to solve the problem. Up until this point i have mainly been using Google Scholar with keywords.
20:10:38 - Ginny Boehme : Ok. And you're getting too much info, or too much irrelevant info?
20:11:33 - Patron : i think it is probably relevant, but I struggle to scan over articles and make sense of it all. If that makes sense
20:12:13 - Ginny Boehme : It absolutely does. Let me see if I can find some good materials for you to start with. Can you hold for a few mintues?
20:13:17 - Patron : yes thank you!
20:13:41 - Ginny Boehme : Sure thing :) I will be back in a few, hopefully with some good stuff

20:22:38 - Ginny Boehme : These should primarily be review articles that cover web accessibility for people visually impairments, and should hopefully help give you an overview of current literature in this area. Review articles are great places to find primary research, so definitely check the references of any good articles you find here

10:29:56 - Patron : cool!
10:30:07 - Katie Gibson : Hi Sam
10:30:21 - Katie Gibson : There is a lot out there that is actually not in any of our databases.
10:30:53 - Katie Gibson : This is a good source with lots of Cuban propaganda posters: <a href=""https://www.marxists.org/subject/art/posters/Cuba/index.htm"" target=""_blank"">https://www.marxists.org/subject/art/posters/Cuba/index.htm</a>
10:31:16 - Patron : oh thats great!
10:32:04 - Katie Gibson : We also have an interesting children's book in Special Collections that also has a propaganda angle, so you might want to schedule an appointment there to see it: <a href=""https://spec.lib.miamioh.edu/home/"" target=""_blank"">https://spec.lib.miamioh.edu/home/</a>
10:32:30 - Katie Gibson : Let me see what I can find for Nicaragua and Sendero Luminoso
10:32:41 - Patron : oh neat ok!
10:33:36 - Katie Gibson : Google Images has quite a few for Shining Path, but you get better results using their name in Spanish: <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=0552b0ba02155725&amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_en&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=AIIjpHxU7SXXniUZfeShr2fp4giZ1Y6MJ25_tmWITc7uy4KIeioyp3OhN11EY0n5qfq-zENwnGygERInUV_0g0XKeHGJBEXLz4R1Z33kknVKOo4klBCBUXB_qzLrdNRNYy8LlRWaXFKzOlk3yrzi6oxXapxWjFAxfhrIczpL5AWNFB0WBcQMuB9tpoXNthqAkUu_GoYURnE0FIwljzoV1i2QsfhhRT3TPg&amp;q=sendero+luminoso+posters&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjrkoXNw-KPAxX8tokEHUdJEr8QtKgLegQIEBAB&amp;biw=1512&amp;bih=823&amp;dpr=2"" target=""_blank"">https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=0552b0ba02155725&amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_en&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=AIIjpHxU7SXXniUZfeShr2fp4giZ1Y6MJ25_tmWITc7uy4KIeioyp3OhN11EY0n5qfq-zENwnGygERInUV_0g0XKeHGJBEXLz4R1Z33kknVKOo4klBCBUXB_qzLrdNRNYy8LlRWaXFKzOlk3yrzi6oxXapxWjFAxfhrIczpL5AWNFB0WBcQMuB9tpoXNthqAkUu_GoYURnE0FIwljzoV1i2QsfhhRT3TPg&amp;q=sendero+luminoso+posters&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjrkoXNw-KPAxX8tokEHUdJEr8QtKgLegQIEBAB&amp;biw=1512&amp;bih=823&amp;dpr=2</a>
10:34:38 - Katie Gibson : And, the Getty image archive has a lot for Nicaragua, but you have to search for the name Sandanistas: <a href=""https://www.gettyimages.com/search/2/image?family=editorial&amp;phrase=sandinista%20revolution%20poster&amp;sort=mostpopular&amp;phraseprocessing=excludenaturallanguage"" target=""_blank"">https://www.gettyimages.com/search/2/image?family=editorial&amp;phrase=sandinista%20revolution%20poster&amp;sort=mostpopular&amp;phraseprocessing=excludenaturallanguage</a>
10:35:21 - Patron : awesome, how like reputable is it to pull images from google for a paper? Would I like reverse google search to source it correctly?
10:35:31 - Patron : *reverse image search?
10:36:04 - Katie Gibson : You can do that, but it might help you to stick to reputable image archives like Getty Images
10:36:21 - Katie Gibson : Let me see what they have for Sendero Luminoso
10:36:31 - Patron : ok yeah
10:36:36 - Katie Gibson : Is this for Dr. Albarran's class?
10:36:59 - Katie Gibson : hm, they have far less for Sendero Luminoso
10:38:14 - Katie Gibson : Talk to her, but you can probably use any images so long as you are sure they are from the movement you are examining and if you cite them correctly. 
10:39:16 - Patron : Its actually for Dr. Norris' soviet propaganda class, but the assignment is to do a comparative paper, so I'm gonna compare soviet propaganda to that of these latin american revolutions. I have taken that class with Dr. Albarran, and I was planning on reaching out to her anyways to see if she has additional stuff.
10:39:33 - Katie Gibson : Oh, cool!
10:39:35 - Patron : this is all super helpful for now, so thank you so much!
10:39:37 - Katie Gibson : That sounds fun
10:39:46 - Katie Gibson : I'm sure you can also talk to him
10:39:51 - Patron : yeah
10:40:08 - Katie Gibson : and see but I'm guessing you can use any image so long as it can be attributed to the right movement
10:40:43 - Patron : yeah, exactly and I'll do my best to find the writer/artist to give it some context
10:41:06 - Katie Gibson : Yes, that makes for a more complete analysis
10:41:12 - Katie Gibson : good idea
10:41:38 - Patron : ok well, now I have a lot to look through, but thanks for your help!!
10:41:44 - Katie Gibson : but next time you are in Spec. ask Rachel about the Cuban kids book
10:41:57 - Patron : oh yes ok! its part of havighurst right?
10:42:35 - Katie Gibson : Kind of? Havighurst's name is on the whole of special collection and on a sub-collection
10:42:52 - Katie Gibson : it's not a part of the sub-collection, but it's in the special collections if that makes sense
10:43:14 - Patron : but its like the same place in the library right?
10:43:21 - Katie Gibson : yes
10:43:46 - Patron : gotcha, is that a like walk in situation or a schedule an appointment kind of thing?
10:44:10 - Katie Gibson : Either, but I'll let her know a student in Dr. Norris' class is interested in seeing it too
10:44:53 - Patron : awesome
10:45:40 - Patron : well im going to go. I've got posters to interpret! thanks for all the help!!

13:50:29 - Patron : Yes! Thank you!
13:52:03 - Barry Zaslow : You're welcome. If you have situations like this the best way to discover whether we have access is to use the Journal Finder link from the library home page, then put in the title of the journal like Ecological Restoration and it should tell which databases include which years. In this case it is in Environment Complete. Hope this makes sense.
13:53:02 - Barry Zaslow : Don't hesitate to ask on chat or e-mail, however since this can be rather complicated given our new library system that was introduced in late June 2025.
14:05:05 - Barry Zaslow : Crystal--Since it's been about 15 minutes since we last chatted I'm closing the window. Have a great afternoon!

14:50:49 - Barry Zaslow : Both the Core Collection and All Databases under Web of Science are working correctly from King right now. In one case I did have to x out a ""cookies"" warning and in the other a ""learn more"" but once those minimized I was able to do a basic search and got results.
14:52:34 - Barry Zaslow : Have you tried clearing your cache, using a different browser or an incognito window? Those are are normal ""fixes"" to check if it's not a true issue with the database itself, although I will be glad to submit a ticket for you if none of that works. At times it's a challenge to replicate such situations.

10:26:03 - Patron : Hi Erica, thank you so much. Of course yes, take your time.
10:29:19 - Erica Freed : I would recommend using two databases, <a href=""https://research.ebsco.com/c/zqi6vd/search/advanced/filters?defaultdb=eric"" target=""_blank"">ERIC</a>  and <a href=""https://research.ebsco.com/c/zqi6vd/search/advanced/filters?defaultdb=ehh"" target=""_blank"">Education Research Complete</a> , and starting with keywords like ""teacher wellbeing"", ""community engagement"", and ""middle school"" to start your search. Jaclyn Spraetz is our Educational Leadership librarian, so I'll try to connect you to her or you can email her at spraetj@miamioh.edu for a more in-depth consultation. One moment!
10:30:06 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Hi Rashmika! I'm happy to see what sources I can find on your research topic
10:30:25 - Patron : Hey, Thank you so much for connecting me with Jaclyn.
10:30:44 - Patron : Hi Jaclyn
10:31:22 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I am able to see your initial question so let me see what I can find on teacher wellbeing, community engagement, and middle schools
10:31:37 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I also want to share this research guide with you which may be helpful as well: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/edl"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/edl</a>
10:31:41 - Patron : Thank you so much for joining the conversation. Okay sure. Thank you so much
10:33:52 - Jaclyn Spraetz : It might be helpful to start with a few different searches that look at 1) teacher mental health in middle schools, 2) community engagement and teacher mental health and 3) community engagement and middle schools
10:34:04 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Here are sources on teacher mental health and middle schools: <a href=""https://research-ebsco-com.proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/c/zqi6vd/search/results?q=(DE%20%22Teacher%20health%22%20or%20teacher%20mental%20health)%20and%20middle%20school&amp;autocorrect=y&amp;db=ehh%2Ceric&amp;expanders=concept&amp;limiters=None&amp;resetPageNumber=true&amp;searchMode=boolean&amp;searchSegment=all-results&amp;skipResultsFetch=true"" target=""_blank"">https://research-ebsco-com.proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/c/zqi6vd/search/results?q=(DE%20%22Teacher%20health%22%20or%20teacher%20mental%20health)%20and%20middle%20school&amp;autocorrect=y&amp;db=ehh%2Ceric&amp;expanders=concept&amp;limiters=None&amp;resetPageNumber=true&amp;searchMode=boolean&amp;searchSegment=all-results&amp;skipResultsFetch=true</a>
10:34:44 - Jaclyn Spraetz : It looks like ""burnout"" might be a good term and there may be other search terms to use for ""teacher mental health"" as well
10:36:25 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Here are some sources on community engagement and middle schools: <a href=""https://research-ebsco-com.proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/c/zqi6vd/search/results?q=community%20engagement%20and%20middle%20school&amp;autocorrect=y&amp;db=ehh%2Ceric&amp;expanders=concept&amp;limiters=None&amp;resetPageNumber=true&amp;searchMode=boolean&amp;searchSegment=all-results"" target=""_blank"">https://research-ebsco-com.proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/c/zqi6vd/search/results?q=community%20engagement%20and%20middle%20school&amp;autocorrect=y&amp;db=ehh%2Ceric&amp;expanders=concept&amp;limiters=None&amp;resetPageNumber=true&amp;searchMode=boolean&amp;searchSegment=all-results</a>
10:36:33 - Patron : Thank you so much Jaclyn, These are really helpful. I am so glad that you are helping me. I was so stressed during the past few weeks coz I  had no idea of the US education system. I think with these stuff, I will be able do a better job. Thank you so much.

13:29:56 - Patron : my topic is for nursing about postpartum complications
13:31:00 - Megan Jaskowiak : The best database to use is CINAHL. I will start a search for you and send you the link
13:31:32 - Patron : ok thankyou
13:32:18 - Megan Jaskowiak : Do you have specifics about the articles you can use? publication age, only research articles, etc?
13:32:46 - Patron : Current practice; published within the last 5 years
• A research study; i.e. not a review manuscript, definition of complication, critique of care guidelines, etc.
• A research study typically includes the following article sections: abstract, introduction, sample &amp; methods, results,
discussion/conclusion, and references
• The topic is not restrictive in nature, for example if the topic of the week is postpartum hemorrhage, this could be a
study looking at interventions used to manage PPH, impact of PPH on maternal healing or breastfeeding, influence of
PPH on perception of birth trauma, etc.
13:32:52 - Patron : those are the guidlines
13:36:47 - Megan Jaskowiak : Is there a specific postpartum complication you are looking for. For example, the instructions use hemorrhaging

12:16:34 - Barry Zaslow : Hello. Let me see what our possibilities are for this. Please hold on.
12:18:04 - Patron : thank you
12:20:14 - Barry Zaslow : Yes, unfortunately the Journal of School Leadership is not one of the Sage titles in our subscription. However, if you are a Miami University affiliated user (faculty, staff, student) you can request the article on Interlibrary Loan here: <a href=""https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html"" target=""_blank"">https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html</a>
12:20:39 - Patron : Ok. I am a student and I am logged in. I will try that now
12:21:05 - Barry Zaslow : If you have not yet used this service create an account using your unique ID/password, then new request, article, and fill in the boxes with your citation. The staff will try to find it at another university/college and have it scanned as a PDF and send you a link.
12:21:41 - Barry Zaslow : It may take a few days depending on the responding institution, just FYI.
12:22:34 - Patron : Thank you for this
12:22:43 - Barry Zaslow : You're welcome. Anything else at this time?
12:23:12 - Patron : Nope! Thank you!
12:23:24 - Barry Zaslow : OK. Have a good (cooler) afternoon.
12:26:14 - Patron : You do the same!

It might be worthwhile to call ahead and make sure we have what you need before you drop by, and I think it might also be worthwhile to discuss your plans in more detail with one of our circulation staff as soon as you can. Just in case there's something important to know or consider that I'm not thinking of (we here on chat do not work directly with our circulation or checkouts, so I'm not well versed in that area)

You can't limit your search to annotated bibliographies in the same way that you would for books or articles.

18:35:14 - Nate Floyd : What does RER stand for? 
18:35:40 - Patron : Review of Educational Research (onlin)
18:35:51 - Patron : *online
18:36:34 - Patron : Here is part of the instructions from the prof:
18:36:38 - Patron : First, visit the Miami University Library website and look up the Review of Educational Research (Online)Links to an external site.. 

You can search inside the journal and find pertinent topics.  I want you to use RER FIRST because it is one of the most widely read and respected journals in education.  Only 5% of literature reviews are accepted for publication, so the level of quality will likely be quite high.
18:36:58 - Nate Floyd : OK one second...
18:38:04 - Nate Floyd : I would probably search using the following terms: <li>Teacher diversity</li>
<li>Staff diversity</li>
<li>Educator demographics</li>
<li>School workforce diversity</li>
<li>Teacher-student demographic match/mismatch</li>
<li>Racial/ethnic representation in teaching</li>
<li>Cultural congruence in schools</li>
18:38:32 - Nate Floyd : I don't know for certain that this journal has published on this topic, but I would probably start there. 
18:38:55 - Nate Floyd : If you can't find anything, then I would go to academic search complete: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/academic-search-complete"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/academic-search-complete</a>
18:39:35 - Patron : Thanks. From there I have to elect 3 articles and populate the chart. Those articles are supposed to be pulled from the list of resources from the main peer-reviewed article.
18:40:08 - Nate Floyd : That's a good strategy. Find one article, and then look at the references for that article.
18:40:27 - Nate Floyd : So, once you find an article that covers this topic, you'll likely find more in that paper's reference section
18:40:55 - Patron : Great, thanks again
18:41:01 - Nate Floyd : Good luck w your work! 
18:41:06 - Nate Floyd : Great topic!
18:41:39 - Patron : I'm excited about the topic but nervous about the whole process. So I appreciate the well wishes.

15:31:44 - Barry Zaslow : I see your account expired July 1st 2025. You will probably want to talk with the folks in King Circulation at 513-529-4141. They should be able to update your record. If you prefer sending them an e-mail you can use the libfines@miamioh.edu address.  They do a lot more than fines there. Hope this helps.

15:43:44 - Barry Zaslow : Dr. Dainoff--I went ahead and called the circulation desk and your account should be good for another year (from today, Sept. 26, 2025). I will also send an e-mail to your Miami address with that information. Best wishes

Can you give me a bit more information about FEPP? Is this a financial program or something more related to sociology? Perhaps then I can suggest a database or two
16:50:05 - Patron : I believe the project is regarding financial aspects of retirement planning, but it is for my social work class on family resource management. There might be a crossover of different topics, so any help with which direction(s) to go would be helpful!
16:55:36 - Barry Zaslow : OK. I briefly looked online for FEPP and the two things I found were something about forestry property and a Massachusetts hospital program for responding to psychological illness but it doesn't sound like either of these are your area. Anyway, for the finance end of things I would start with Business Source Complete under Databases A-Z from the library home page. You can put keywords in the boxes and choose ""all text"" then limit by years, peer-reviewed (scholarly), etc. Coming at it from the sociology viewpoint SocIndex would be a recommendation also in the A-Z list with similar search boxes, etc.

Let me look into this for you.
15:54:56 - Stefanie Hilles : What database are you in?
15:55:28 - Patron : I'm sorry but what do you mean by database.
15:56:29 - Stefanie Hilles : I am sorry. I am confused
15:56:46 - Stefanie Hilles : Can you explain more what is happening? Or can you tell me about your assignment so I can help you?
16:00:11 - Patron : I don't really know how to explain it more. Im trying to think right now.
16:00:45 - Stefanie Hilles : Can you copy and paste any of the assignment here?
16:00:52 - Patron : Sure I can.
16:01:10 - Patron : Part A - Basic Search

1) Select a geologic topic consisting of two related geologic terms. For example, ""hotspot AND volcano"", or ""meteorite AND diamond"" (don't use these as your example). 

2) Perform a basic ""Articles &amp; More"" search from the university libraries page <a href=""http://www.lib.miamioh.eduLinks"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lib.miamioh.eduLinks</a> to an external site., with the ""Scholarly (Peer Reviewed Journals)"" box checked.

3) Find two recent (within the last 5 years) articles from the results of this search.

Part B - Georef/GeoScienceWorld Search

1) Next perform a search on the same two terms using the Georef search engine, which you can find by going to ""Databases A-Z"" page, and selecting ""G"", or by going to this linkLinks to an external site..

2) Find two recent (within the last 5 years) articles, not including the articles you identified in from the basic search.

Part C - Report Your Results

5) Create and upload a document identifying your search terms (e.g., ""hotspot AND volcano""), and listing the two sets of two articles that you identified from your basic search and GeoRef searches described above. List them using the so-called ""APA"" author-year citation style. For example, one recent article resulting from the ""hotspot volcano"" search example is:

Hoernle, K., Schwindrofska, A., Werner, R., van den Bogaard, P., Hauff, F., Uenzelmann-Neben, G., &amp; Garbe-Schönberg, D. (2016). Tectonic dissection and displacement of parts of Shona hotspot volcano 3500 km along the Agulhas-Falkland Fracture Zone. Geology, 44(4), 263-266. doi:10.1130/G37582.1

To obtain the citation, click on the article in either search engine, and then click the ""Citation"" tool under ""Send to"", and then select APA. You can then copy the resulting citation. You can also follow the APA (7th edition) format by looking at the examples linked hereLinks to an external site..
16:02:20 - Stefanie Hilles : Cool! This helps. I see why this was hard to explain!

09:06:15 - Nate Floyd : The note about ""resource sharing is only allowed under certain terms"" but it does not state what those terms are 
09:06:20 - Nate Floyd : Frustrating! 
09:06:33 - Patron : right... figured that OH Link has it, so that means sharing is possible
09:09:00 - Nate Floyd : In many cases, chapters are made available (or not) according to the author's wishes. It's possible the authors have not consented here.
09:09:08 - Nate Floyd : In any case, I just reported it as a problem in the primo system 
09:09:20 - Nate Floyd : Because it's not clear what the problem is, or what the terms are 
09:09:32 - Patron : is there any way I can access it, short of requesting the book in the future?

09:10:50 - Nate Floyd : That's what I would do, I think that is probably the best option 
09:11:26 - Nate Floyd : As a long shot, you could contact the author (track them down online), and ask for access. Sometimes these book chapters start as articles or conference presentations 
09:11:30 - Nate Floyd : I've had luck that way before 
09:11:31 - Patron : OK, they will do a chapter, not an article?

Scholarly articles are good for looking at larger trends so you could find things on student housing and costs that look more broadly

13:05:07 - Barry Zaslow : Here is a database I would recommend. America : history and Life which you can find off the main library page under Databases A-Z. You can put Ulysses Grant in one search box (I used ""all text"" as my parameter) and then I used policies in the second box (also ""all text"") and got what look like some useful matches. You could also try different words like foreign or domestic. Does this sound helpful?
13:05:49 - Patron : yes thank you
13:07:02 - Barry Zaslow : You're welcome. You could also find some other resources in Databases A-Z if you chose subject ""history"" at the top but this one seemed relevant.
13:09:41 - Barry Zaslow : Some of the citations will have PDFs you can look at right away (even under the phrase access options) while others may need to be requested or if you are on campus we might have print versions at the libraries.

16:44:52 - Mark Dahlquist : Hi Kaara! Sorry you've had some trouble accessing a journal.
16:45:14 - Patron : Thanks. This happens occasionally if I'm just connected regularly, so not sure that's why
16:45:32 - Mark Dahlquist : Hmm. Well, I'm happy to try to troubleshoot this.
16:45:51 - Patron : when I click on the journal issues available online, I get a log in page from the host; it cna't tell I'm logged in to Miami
16:46:17 - Mark Dahlquist : Is there a particular article you are searching for? Or are you interested in browsing this publication?
16:47:17 - Patron : Yes, I am looking for this: Sachiko Kusukawa, ""The Sources of Gessner's Pictures for the Historia Animalium,"" Annals of Science 67.3 (2010) 303-28
16:47:35 - Mark Dahlquist : Ok, hold on one moment, please.

16:50:08 - Mark Dahlquist : Hopefully that works!
16:50:48 - Patron : It did, thank you! Do you think it's just that journal or because I'm using VPN? I don't recall that being an issue before
16:51:03 - Patron : I mean, just that link to the journal through Miami sites
16:51:06 - Mark Dahlquist : I have heard that you may have left Miami, by the way. Is this the case? It may be that your access has expired, if so.
16:51:31 - Patron : it hasn't, but yes, I have just taken early retirement, in effect. I'm in London on a research grant now and next year
16:51:34 - Mark Dahlquist : Though I am not sure whether this is the issue.
16:51:57 - Patron : I occasionally run into this disconnect between a record and its actual access at the partner publisher
16:52:08 - Patron : through Miami
16:52:18 - Patron : but this is a new system...
16:52:38 - Mark Dahlquist : Ah, I see. Hmm. Well, I'm sorry that you've run into this issue. It should work even without a VPN. 
16:52:52 - Mark Dahlquist : One useful trick can be to try searching with Google scholar.
16:53:11 - Patron : sometimes the old Miami catalogue works; it does for things I know are there but aren't coming up
16:53:14 - Mark Dahlquist : Sometime it is better at locating articles that the ProQuest search interface.
16:53:28 - Patron : yes, it's the PQ interface that's usually the culprit
16:54:05 - Mark Dahlquist : Yes, unfortunately we are still working to optimize this system (and trying to hire a replacement e-resources librarian to lead this process).
16:54:08 - Patron : OK, so it's more likely just this link and not how I'm accessing.
16:54:27 - Patron : Got it. Thank you for the help and nice to run into you virtually :)
16:54:37 - Patron : I'm still doing a lot of research!
16:54:47 - Mark Dahlquist : You're welcome! Good to hear from you, too!
16:54:56 - Mark Dahlquist : Glad things are going well :)
16:55:05 - Patron : thank you, I hope for you too

11:26:34 - Patron : I need 2 peer reviewed sources out of 8 total, so this can be one of them that is not peer reviewed
11:27:10 - Roger Justus : News articles can be used as sources but are not Peer Reviewed.  So yea you can use this as one of those non-peer reviewed sources.
11:27:33 - Patron : Ok, the sources just need to pass the CRAAP test
11:29:03 - Roger Justus : That should be able to. It is two years old, so if the assignment has a date requirement, you may want to see if there is a more recent article.  But I think it is ok, you can check with your Professor as well. 
11:29:35 - Patron : 2020 and after that. Thank you for your help!

17:05:51 - Mark Dahlquist : Whether an ILL book can be renewed is up to the lending institution. In some cases you may see an option to renew in in the ILL view that may allow you to do this.
17:06:11 - Mark Dahlquist : This option is separate from the loan status of Miami items.
17:06:47 - Patron : Oh okay. I unfortunately am not seeing that as an option.
17:07:40 - Mark Dahlquist : Hmm. That might mean you are out of luck. However, it might be worth attempting to contact the lending institution to see if they would be willing to extend the loan.

13:32:33 - Laura Birkenhauer : I tried searching for (race OR racial OR diversity) AND ""media representation"" to expand the results a bit 
13:34:37 - Patron : Thank you! If I wanted to narrow down the results a bit more (for example, articles discussing women specifically), I would include that in the search bar above?
13:35:17 - Laura Birkenhauer : Yes! You can always add keywords to the search bar, using AND or OR. For example: 

(race OR racial OR diversity) AND ""media representation"" AND women
13:35:38 - Laura Birkenhauer : (race OR racial OR diversity) AND ""media representation"" AND (women OR female OR gender)
13:36:33 - Patron : Okay, I see. Thank you! How can I check that a source I select is peer reviwed?
13:36:37 - Patron : *reviewed
13:36:55 - Laura Birkenhauer : There is a limiter on the left side of the page that allows you to narrow to peer reviewed journals only!
13:37:01 - Laura Birkenhauer : Let me know if you can't find it though
13:37:54 - Patron : If I wanted to find a more recently published article that DISCUSSES media representations from the early 2000s, how would I word that in the search bar?
13:38:49 - Laura Birkenhauer : That's what a another librarian and I were just discussing about this topic, that it's going to be much tricker to find articles like that if they exist. Let me do some searching to try some different ideas, and see what might work.
13:39:34 - Patron : I see. Thank you for your efforts. I will continue to search as well.
13:45:01 - Laura Birkenhauer : Adding time related keywords to the search doesn't seem to be finding me much that's relevant. I've tried adding ""21st century"" and ""millennium"" and adding 200* (which would find any mention of a year that starts with 200, such as 2001, 2002, 2003, etc) and I'm not having luck. 
13:45:28 - Laura Birkenhauer : What class is this for? 
13:46:03 - Laura Birkenhauer : Since we're having trouble identifying useful search terms to find what you need, it may be beneficial to meet with the librarian for the subject area that you're doing research for.  
13:46:34 - Laura Birkenhauer : For example, the librarian for media and communication is Mark Dahlquist <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/c.php?g=923511"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/c.php?g=923511</a>
13:46:52 - Laura Birkenhauer : He could help make suggestions for your research via email or you can also make an appointment from his profile on that page I sent
13:50:16 - Patron : I understand. Adding time related terms to the search bar were not proving to be extremely helpful. This research paper I am working on is for MAC 212 (Media, Representation, and Society). I think Mark would be a wonderful source for more information. Thank you for providing his contact and for helping me with my research!
13:50:39 - Laura Birkenhauer : You're welcome! I think he will be very helpful with this project! Let me know if you have any further questions! 
13:50:47 - Patron : Thank you, I will!

18:32:00 - Kristen Adams : For a classic example, if you give me a minute, I could find it for you. There was a news story, a long time ago before the animal rights movement started, it was about a kidnapped dog. Time magazine ran a story about it and it sparked a lot of animal rights requlations.

18:36:05 - Kristen Adams : This is from an animal care training module. Just for background so you can look up these acts. 
18:36:11 - Kristen Adams : ""

Wayman published graphic images of the horrendous conditions under which dogs were kept, often without ample food or water.  Several images were of skeletal remains. Legislation was first in place in April,1966 (covering only dogs and cats, but not laboratory environment). Within 6 months of the publishing of these images in LIFE, on August 24, 1966, The Laboratory Animal Welfare Act was signed into legislation. Images of the cruelty surrounding the stolen animals sold for research struck a cord with the public who rallied to push for bill to protect animals. Over the years, the Animal Welfare Act went through different iterations.

What kind of sources do you need? Are you required, for example, to use peer reviewed journal articles? 
12:04:53 - Laura Birkenhauer : Your topic is very broad, so when we do a search we're going to find a lot of results! So you may want to browse the results and think about how to narrow down your topic. Let me do some searching now and see what I can find.
12:05:12 - Patron : may include a variety of scholarly journal articles, news, books, and websites
12:05:37 - Patron : That is a good idea narrowing my topic could be helpful but I dont know where to start

12:07:59 - Laura Birkenhauer : There are lots of results, so you can get ideas for what kind of topic you might be interested in focusing on by skimming the titles, subjects, and abstracts for these articles
12:08:29 - Laura Birkenhauer : If you're able to use websites, the Miami University Student Counseling Service likely has a lot of useful resources on their website that you could cite
12:08:38 - Laura Birkenhauer : And same for the Office of Student Wellness
12:08:55 - Laura Birkenhauer : I can also see if I can narrow our results down to anything published by Miami University authors

12:09:54 - Laura Birkenhauer : YOu might try exploring those two websites for resources, articles, etc.
12:11:53 - Patron : this is for a annotated bibliography about the need for change in a local community do you have any ideas of what i can do for mental health around Miami or schools in general
12:15:05 - Laura Birkenhauer : I think browsing those websites will help give you ideas. You could also chat with staff in those offices. The director of the Student Counseling Service has often done presentations on campus about the state of student mental health at Miami. I haven't seen one of those talks in a couple years, but if you reach out to them, they could perhaps give you more information about current needs.

12:26:46 - Laura Birkenhauer : What is your topic? 
12:27:17 - Laura Birkenhauer : And where have you been searching? 
12:27:24 - Patron : its a project on writing and communication in a career of our choice i chose psychology
12:27:42 - Patron : i've been searching on the online Miami library
12:29:14 - Laura Birkenhauer : OK, let me see what I can find. Are you required to use a certain kind of source? I'm not sure that peer reviewed articles are going to be the best source for this topic. I am thinking that the career center, for example, may have more useful information about careers in a particular area - but that may be from a website, not an article.
12:30:18 - Laura Birkenhauer : <a href=""https://miamioh.edu/centers-institutes/career-center/explore/index.html"" target=""_blank"">https://miamioh.edu/centers-institutes/career-center/explore/index.html</a> Vault Career Insider is one of the career center resources that came to mind. It's linked toward the bottom of this page
12:30:38 - Laura Birkenhauer : I'll also see what other resources may be available through the library, though. Thanks for holding.
12:30:58 - Patron : this is all thats said on research ""In order to gather the information you’ll need for this project, you’ll need to conduct extensive research. I expect you might need to engage in both primary research and secondary research in order to collect the necessary material"" but he recommends primary sources
12:31:50 - Laura Birkenhauer : OK - so in this case, a great primary source would be an interview! You could interview someone who works for, for example, Miami's Student Counseling Center about their job and its involvement with communication/writing.
12:32:47 - Patron : Okay, I'll keep that in mind, but for right now, I'm working on an annotated bibliography and need about 10 sources.
12:34:18 - Laura Birkenhauer : Sure. And an interview (or any other primary source) is a source you can include in an annotated bibliography. I'll see if I have any other recommendations.
12:34:32 - Patron : ok!

18:10:26 - Jenny Presnell : I think this is by insustry? let me take a look --
18:10:52 - Jenny Presnell : tell me what you are looking for
18:13:27 - Patron : Yes for my consumer analysis report I need determine the target consumers for my brand Tampax and discuss the demographics and psychographics of the target consumers, and how the target consumers of your product may have changed over time using the Miami marketing databases. My industry is Tampax.

Demographics: race, gender, age, education, income, class, occupation, etc. (Given that all products want to be flexible and inclusive, make sure to talk about how these brands target particular kind of consumers but also flexible enough so that these brands can broaden their consumer base and manage the differences). You should give specific data, especially social economic status.
18:13:55 - Patron : So, I am trying to use MRI simmons to compare demographics and and psychographics for Tampax users
18:14:00 - Jenny Presnell : ok
18:14:07 - Patron : But I am unsure how to pull that data to compare
18:14:53 - Jenny Presnell : I think your industry is feminine products -- I'll do some searching
18:16:29 - Jenny Presnell : this may take me a minute -- I see what your problems are
18:16:43 - Patron : I found Tampax under Health and Beauty Aids on MRI Simmons, but was not sure how to see the specific demographics for the brand. Thank you!
18:18:45 - Jenny Presnell : what course is this for

For nearly two decades, her attention to detail and tireless dedication played a crucial role in helping us serve our community. But beyond the spreadsheets and reports, she was a cherished member of our team – a trusted friend and supportive colleague.

Shoshana touched the lives of all who had the privilege of working with her, and her contributions will never be forgotten. 

As we mourn this tremendous loss, we also honour her life and the lasting impact she had on Astra Centre. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and loved ones during this difficult time.

20:25:39 - Patron : Not as far as I know.  Her son Avi did move to the US and sadly died there.

17:43:02 - Patron : I've only made it through our Libraries website, I think the issue is my research is in the starting phase so I don't have many terms to look up
17:43:33 - Ginny Boehme : Ok let me see what I can find. What class is this for?
17:44:01 - Patron : This is for art 335 study of african art
17:44:16 - Ginny Boehme : ok I will take a look, please hold
17:44:26 - Patron : of course, thank you
17:55:02 - Ginny Boehme : I'm having a hard time as well. Most everything I can find is related to objects and not to monographs. Let me try another couple of things
17:57:36 - Patron : That's fine, do you know if there is an easier way to see if we have a scholarly book review of a specfic book in the libraries?
18:00:23 - Ginny Boehme : It's difficult to search specifically for book reviews, unfortunately. BUT the arts librarian is about to sign on and she is much better equipped than I am to answer your original question. Is it ok if I transfer you to her when she gets here? should be just a minute or two
18:01:07 - Patron : yes thats fine, unfortantly the study of african art has been limited until recently.
18:01:37 - Ginny Boehme : Yes, but she knows the backend tricks to find this info
18:02:09 - Stefanie Hilles : Hi Kayla!
18:02:22 - Patron : hello!
18:03:18 - Stefanie Hilles : Let me see what I can find. The book review part is easy. Ginny is the science librarian so she is much more articles based :)
18:04:34 - Patron : No Problem, my professor would like us to find a monograph on our subject and then a review of that monograph. I think I've found one but I won't be able to confirm till I can get into the library
18:05:18 - Stefanie Hilles : Can you send me the link? I can probably tell from the record. And Jordan and I go way back. All the way back to undergrad. I am super familiar with this assignment

18:07:47 - Stefanie Hilles : That is indeed a monograph!
18:08:16 - Patron : I wasn't able to find anything solely about the libation practices, but ritual practices in general would work as well, most books cover a broad view of Africa
18:09:29 - Stefanie Hilles : I gotchu! I just have two other people on chat right now. You are first but I had to respond to them and all that :)
18:10:21 - Patron : Take your time, I appreciate it!
18:14:18 - Stefanie Hilles : Ok! So, I found something perfect but it's through OhioLINK.

18:16:11 - Patron : I should have enough time, its the ebging phases so I believe he would understand a little delay with the sources
18:16:29 - Stefanie Hilles : I think he would too. And that book is perfect!

18:17:46 - Stefanie Hilles : This encyclopedia has a section on libations. I know you can't use it but it might have a bibliography that would have additional sources
18:18:14 - Patron : Thank you I think that first one would be perfect! how would I go about finding a review of it?
18:19:58 - Stefanie Hilles : So, sometimes there are links to the reviews in the record (you can see that in the encyclopedia one I sent). Since this one doesn't have one of those, I am going to run an article search with the title of the book as my keyword and then I am going to limit to reviews (if I need to - I might not have to. Depends on the results).
18:20:34 - Patron : Ok got it
18:21:18 - Stefanie Hilles : Alas, that didn't work. It doesn't always

09:10:14 - Kristen Adams : I understand the filtering is difficult right now. We updated to a new library system and catalog over the summer and there are things showing as being in our collection that really are not (like this one), and we are working to get those corrected so it's not confusing, but it's a process that takes a while.

12:18:03 - Barry Zaslow : That's fine. I just thought I'd check. Let me see if I can direct you to a good database for some US articles. Please hold on.
12:28:05 - Barry Zaslow : There are two databases that might have some good content--Education Full Text and Education Research Complete in our Databases A-Z list. You can put keywords in the search boxes such as dormitories OR residence halls OR student housing and combine (AND) in a second box with cleanliness. I used the ""all text"" option. You can also limit to the last five years if that seems helpful. I did not see a good way to limit to just US but some of the matches seemed to emanate from states here. Does this sound useful?
12:41:52 - Barry Zaslow : You could also do cleanliness OR hygiene OR mold, too. Sometimes mold doesn't seem to refer to the health issue but rather a mold like an art model so perhaps better to link it to the other words

15:47:25 - Patron : I am looking for information on historical artists. I was defintly going to be looking via arts/arch, but would king not have anything?
15:48:11 - Ginny Boehme : Not to my knowledge. Everything on that topic should be contained in Wertz, to save researchers from having to walk back and forth
15:48:37 - Patron : Ok!
15:49:47 - Ginny Boehme : The Art Librarian, Stefanie Hilles (hillessa@miamioh.edu), would be a good person to check with if you can't find what you need
15:50:35 - Patron : I am also curious if there is a different way of searching things. What I am doing can definitly be helpful, but I feel like there was a different platform that people have told me to search on
15:51:48 - Ginny Boehme : It depends on what you need. The catalog where you are searching right now is good mostly for books. We also have subject databases that primarily contain journal articles. There are lots of resources and info here: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/arthistory"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/arthistory</a>
15:54:11 - Patron : This looks more like what i was looking for! Thank you!

Who is the artist? 
15:32:25 - Patron : For this assignment, you are to again visit the Art History at a Glance exhibition at the art museum. The goal of this assignment is to use what you have learned in class to locate artworks and to locate resources using our library. You are to locate and identify artworks that engage with certain concepts and ideas from our class discussion. There may be multiple pieces that fulfill a certain criteria, and you only need to select 1. 

As with the first Museum Essay, please include a selfie with your selected artwork as proof of your visit :-)

1) Locate the following styles or types of artworks:

still life,
a work associated with the Grand Tour,
a daguerrotype,
a print from the 19th century with political messages, and
a work by an artist associated with French Academic painting. 
These identifications should form the first page of your paper. These IDs should be five bullet points with 1-2 sentences for each artwork discussing how you know that it fulfills that particular criteria as well as what movement it is associated with in 19th century art. You will get one point each for correctly identifying the artworks.

2) Select one of your chosen artworks to explore further. Locate one journal article or book pertaining to it. Start by searching for resources on your specific artist, and if that does not yield interesting results, look for something about the related style, movement, or period of art history (this is where good notes and thoroughly reading the museum label will help you). If it is an article, read it; if it is a book, check it out and skim it.

In a 2-page essay, discuss your piece and what you were able to learn. This component of the assignment should start with the full title of your work and a clear, Chicago Style citation of your selected resource. Then, your essay should be an analysis of your work's position in art history. When you cite any ideas or quotes from your selected scholarly source, be sure to use Chicago Style FootnotesLinks to an external site.. This component of the assignment will be graded on quality of the source your found as well as clarity of your essay. 

Giovanni Battista Piranesi

I am currently inside King Library if it would be better to talk in person","","12","","18:27:43 - Barry Zaslow : Hello Michael. Let me see if we have access to either of those here. Please hold on.
18:30:38 - Barry Zaslow : Here is a link to Ab Imperio: <a href=""https://muse.jhu.edu/journal/573"" target=""_blank"">https://muse.jhu.edu/journal/573</a>
18:31:04 - Barry Zaslow : If you know which year the article appeared you can browse this journal (or you may be able to search for keywords)
18:32:25 - Patron : Will I be able to access the article if I have a Project Muse account
18:33:07 - Barry Zaslow : For the other one we do have a few years in our Special Collections area on the 3rd floor, from 1988-1990 (v.1-3). If it is not in those years you can try Interlibrary Loan at this link:  <a href=""https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html"" target=""_blank"">https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html</a>
18:33:49 - Barry Zaslow : If you go to the link I sent it should work as it's part of the library subscription to Project Muse. I don't think you have to have a separate account.
18:35:09 - Barry Zaslow : Here is the call # for the Revolutionary Russia one in case you find it in those years. Special Collections is open 8-5 weekdays only and materials do not leave their area although they have a scanner. DK 265 .A175a
18:37:14 - Barry Zaslow : The funeral services one looks to be from 2019 so well past our holdings but Interlibrary Loan should work. The other one looks to from 2018 in Ab Imperio
18:37:25 - Barry Zaslow : *be from
18:38:33 - Barry Zaslow : See if this link works for that: <a href=""https://muse.jhu.edu/issue/39646"" target=""_blank"">https://muse.jhu.edu/issue/39646</a>
18:40:20 - Barry Zaslow : It's listed as being on p. 351-384. I'm on third floor King Library and it's showing possibilities for view, download, save but it also says our subscription does not include this content so you may have to try Interlibrary Loan for that one as well unless your particular Project Muse account has more capabilities than ours. Sorry to be confusing.
18:42:57 - Barry Zaslow : If the Interlibrary Loan staff can find it at another institution they should be able to have that school scan it and send you a link in your e-mail. Especially for recent articles (2018/2019) they may be able to get this done fairly quickly although again they are here only business hours weekdays. Hope this helps somewhat.

20:00:15 - Barry Zaslow : For that I would suggest starting with Agricola in Databases A-Z (near the beginning of the ""A"" section) from the library home page. You can put pollinators and neonicotinoids in the search boxes using AND (if you do ""all text"" that will find them as keywords). Also there is a check box for ""peer-reviewed"" which should produce scholarly articles. You may also want to limit to a time period such as the last five years. Does this sound useful?
20:01:03 - Barry Zaslow : There are also a good group of other choices if you put Biology as a subject search in the A-Z list as they have combined botany and agriculture under that broad heading.
20:01:36 - Barry Zaslow : The home page is <a href=""http:www.lib.miamioh.edu"" target=""_blank"">http:www.lib.miamioh.edu</a> and Databases A-Z is the first button in the middle on the left

For example, in Web of Science, topic searches keywords in title, abstract ,and indexing","","13","","12:24:11 - Barry Zaslow : Hello. Can you give me a bit more information? Is the advanced search in Web of Science not giving you results or are you referring to an advanced search somewhere else?
12:25:05 - Patron : Hi Berry, apologies. I meant the advanced search using the MU libraries search
12:26:06 - Barry Zaslow : OK. Let me check for a moment. Please hold on.
12:28:32 - Barry Zaslow : So for a topic use the drop down menu on the left that says search filters/any field and choose the word ""subject"" then you can put your term in the search box to the right . You can combine subject with other fields if you need to using AND below. Does this make sense?
12:29:23 - Patron : yes, thank you. Just to make sure, does subject looks into title and abstract?
12:29:35 - Barry Zaslow : Let me try a sample search.
12:32:50 - Barry Zaslow : It looks like it generates results from the subject headings used for the item, although my term also showed up in some of the titles by coincidence. You could also put a term in the same search box but use the ""all fields"" to get it to find it in subjects, titles, contents, etc. but you may be overwhelmed with results (when I did that I got over 40,000!)
12:33:48 - Barry Zaslow : Usually the more parameters you can provide the better your result set will be but if it doesn't produce worthwhile matches you can broaden or include other fields
12:34:31 - Patron : ok thank you. is there a way to search only in the title and abstract?
12:36:35 - Barry Zaslow : The system allows for a title search but I did not see abstract as a choice. I can mention this to our web services team if you think that would be a useful option. We just switched to a new system for all of Ohio the end of the summer so we're learning as we go.
12:37:45 - Patron : the abstract search would help me a lot to sort out relevant papers. this addition would be great, thank you!
12:38:53 - Barry Zaslow : OK. I will suggest that.
12:39:04 - Patron : Thank you for your help, Have a great rest of your week.

13:04:11 - Patron : Thanks for the link. I need to know how I cahek it out for longer than three five days
13:04:19 - Barry Zaslow : She also said that it is restricted to 5 days but that once the time period is up you can renew (or check out another license) but that's all I see in the information from the 29th around noon. Does this help?
13:05:10 - Patron : ow easy is it to renew the license?
13:06:44 - Barry Zaslow : It depends on how many people might be using the particular software. For Adobe Creative Cloud for faculty/staff there are quite a number of available ones at most times, although for Lightroom specifically I'm not sure. You might want to consult with either the circulation desk at 513-529-4141 (ask for a staff member) or message Mike Bomholt in our Library Systems at bomholmm@miamioh.edu for further specifics

13:08:04 - Patron : Or, is then link above what I need for renewal?
13:08:33 - Barry Zaslow : I don't think there is a link for renewal--you just have to choose a new license, but one of the above areas (circulation or Mike) could verify that. I don't have any more links than the original one.

15:27:09 - Mark Dahlquist : It looks like it is availble via Amazon, so I would suggest going ahead and puttining in an ILL request.

I want to replicate this statement from a paper:

Published literature reveals that the frequency of publication related to earlier paradigms, such as flexible manufacturing systems (FMS), reconfigurable manufacturing
systems (RMS), and changeable manufacturing systems
(CMS), had peaked in 2010. Papers relating to smart
(SMS), intelligent (IMS), and cyber-physical manufacturing systems (CPS) were on a steep rise in the last
decade. Figure 1 illustrates the results of a Scopus search
for the selected keywords in documents published in the
last 15 years, annually since the year 2006. Publications
about adaptive manufacturing systems (AMS) continue
to increase, and those about cognitive manufacturing systems (CMS) have emerged in the last few years and are
steadily increasing.

10:23:43 - Jenny Presnell : so don't go away
10:24:33 - Jenny Presnell : When you say replicate -- do you mean direct quote
10:24:35 - Jenny Presnell : brb
10:26:47 - Patron : No in that paper they have Figure 1 which contains the count of the papers based on each key term. I want to redo this for more recent years (the replication will ensure I understand how they did the search; what did they limit the search to)
10:28:31 - Jenny Presnell : The university, as i understand it, is the one providing access to scopus, without any input or association with the library
10:28:36 - Jenny Presnell : most of the questions we have had
10:28:43 - Jenny Presnell : deal with citations
10:29:17 - Patron : Ah that's a different piece; the university through SciVal want faculty to use this for workload.
10:30:02 - Patron : My ask is quite different. I am interested in understanding how the authors did their search as when I used the crossRef API I got widely different and non-decreasing values
10:30:51 - Jenny Presnell : I think it would be best for you to contact a science librarian. 
10:31:07 - Jenny Presnell : I'll send contact information

11:02:43 - Jenny Presnell : there are several sections
11:02:55 - Jenny Presnell : case law federal and state
11:03:02 - Jenny Presnell : then there is a section of law reviews
11:03:05 - Jenny Presnell : and then also
11:03:21 - Jenny Presnell : a section that is called encyclopedias/secondary sources

11:03:45 - Jenny Presnell : Links from the main landing page
11:03:50 - Patron : Thank you so much! This is so helpful.
11:04:11 - Patron : Would i just look up terms and rules under the search section?

11:05:25 - Patron : Yep
11:05:47 - Jenny Presnell : that helps let me poke around a bit and see where its best for you to start
11:06:00 - Patron : Thanks so much
11:06:31 - Patron : Only cite cases, legislation, Restatement or Black's Law Dictionary. You can directly quote from cases or paraphrase.
13. Do not cite AmJur2d, CJS, or OJur3d
14. You are an Ohio court. Recent Ohio cases would carry more weight. However - you can use cases from other state and older cases if they have not been overturned. A red flag on Westlaw means it has been overturned. On some fact patterns (not many) you can be a court in a different state.
11:06:43 - Patron : ^ A canvas message from him
11:06:59 - Jenny Presnell : so you need Ohio Cases?
11:07:06 - Jenny Presnell : or other state cases
11:07:17 - Patron : He said we should use ohio but can use other states if we have to

11:13:18 - Jaclyn Spraetz : You can also go directly to interlibrary loan to request the article: <a href=""https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html"" target=""_blank"">https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html</a>
11:13:54 - Patron : Resource sharing is only allowed under specific terms and conditions
11:14:18 - Jaclyn Spraetz : There is a link above that to request through interlibrary loan
11:14:59 - Jaclyn Spraetz : You can also use this link to directly request in the interlibrary loan account: <a href=""https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html"" target=""_blank"">https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html</a>
11:15:15 - Patron : am I understanding rigth, I think it doesnt have digital copy?
11:15:50 - Jaclyn Spraetz : If you request through interlibrary loan you will get a digital copy. It will be shared with you as a PDF
11:16:07 - Jaclyn Spraetz : It usually does not take very long. I often get them the same day or within the next couple of days
11:16:07 - Patron : oh, so why I can not see it directly
11:16:55 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I completely understand the confusion. Our catalog when you search on the main page for ""everything,"" it will look like the Libraries own things we do not actually own
11:17:01 - Jaclyn Spraetz : It looks like that is the case with this article
11:17:42 - Jaclyn Spraetz : You can search specifically what the Libraries have access to by searching MU Libraries or Articles in the right dropdown menu
11:18:20 - Patron : ok thank you for clariying that
11:18:34 - Jaclyn Spraetz : You're welcome! Sorry about the confusion on our catalog! 
11:18:44 - Patron : have a great day, thank you

13:43:03 - Patron : Thank you!
13:43:46 - Mark Dahlquist : By the way, are you searching in a particular EBSCO database? I should mention that most Miami library search tools are now configured to go through ProQuest, rather than EBSCO.
13:45:12 - Mark Dahlquist : EBSCO does have a guide to creating EBSCO accounts, which can be found <a href=""https://connect.ebsco.com/s/article/How-to-Create-and-Manage-a-My-EBSCOhost-Account?language=en_US"" target=""_blank"">at this link.</a>

13:45:43 - Patron : I'm doing a systematic lit review and searching a few different databases - environment complete, biological and agricultural index and jstor. When I click on the links to go to those databases it takes me to EBSCO,
13:46:07 - Mark Dahlquist : I see, thanks.
13:46:15 - Patron : I did try and make an account using those steps and it didn't work
13:47:58 - Mark Dahlquist : Hmm. Have you considered using an external tool for saving references, such as Zotero or Mendelay?
13:48:23 - Mark Dahlquist : That might have some advantages over using tool-specific accounts.
13:48:37 - Patron : Oh wait! It worked! You need an account to export to Zotero but I must have entered something wrong previously!
13:49:02 - Mark Dahlquist : Great! Glad to hear this! Is there anything else I can help with right now?
13:49:21 - Patron : No, I'm all good now! Thanks for your help!
