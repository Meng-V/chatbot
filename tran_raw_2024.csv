I am curious if the Library has the ability to scan a large format sheet (~ 4 ft. x 3 ft.). We have some instrument manuals that have drawings we are attempting to convert into electronic format. If so, could you please let me know? Thanks.","","4","","12:16:43 - Barry Zaslow : Prof. Weeks: I'm not sure about this but you might contact the Makerspace at create@miamioh.edu as they have most of the latest technologies in the library spaces. We do have regular book scanners on most floors at King and at Art/Architecture although I don't think any are that large. Hope this helps.
12:17:17 - Patron : Hi Barry, thanks - this is very helpful. Have a great day.
12:18:16 - Barry Zaslow : You too. Some people may still be off for break but there should be staff monitoring that e-mail address. They are located on 3rd floor King and do appointments 9-5 weekdays in case you want to stop up and see what's there.
12:19:13 - Patron : Sounds great. Thanks again!

12:32:04 - Patron : thank you
12:34:27 - Barry Zaslow : It looks like the 2020 edition is at one Ohio school and is available. If you go to the library home page <a href=""http://www.lib.miamioh.edu"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lib.miamioh.edu</a> then click on the OhioLINK blue line just below the search box you can put in the title HRM core concepts and it's the first match with a ""request item"" button. Does this make sense?
12:38:07 - Patron : so can I rent it ?
12:40:20 - Barry Zaslow : If you choose request item and put in your Miami credentials (unique ID/password), choose a pickup location, then they will try to get it from Sinclair Community College for you. Usually you can keep books for three weeks with renewals if no one else needs them.

12:24:12 - Patron : thanks
12:25:30 - Barry Zaslow : It looks like from their own documentation and some supporting sites that questioned similarly that they include books but of course the universe they search is limited to books which have digital availability so I assume some might be missed if they are only in print. Does this help?
12:29:30 - Patron : So you mean only the books in digital format, the submission can be checked against them?
12:33:35 - Barry Zaslow : Yes, the latter seems correct. If you would like to reach out to a few people who are more savvy about this I'd recommend Nate Floyd, our Student Success Librarian for Foundational Learning at floydns@miamioh.edu or Carla Myers, our Scholarly Communcations/Copyright expert at myersc2@miamioh.edu. Both of them would be valuable resources, I trust for this if my investigations aren't providing definitive results.
12:36:24 - Patron : Thanks. To your knowledge, does our library have some more robust plagiarism check tools than Turnitin?
12:37:27 - Barry Zaslow : I don't know but if you have time to check with Nate or Carla they might be aware of such.

10:34:17 - Kristen Adams : but i'm not sure where the first one came from, which is why citing it is difficult
10:35:58 - Kristen Adams : The best fit, I think would be some kind of conference session or presentation because it's not from a journal article, a book, a webpage or other types of sources that APA defines

12:18:14 - Barry Zaslow : What we usually suggest is they go to Databases A-Z on the library home page and choose ""W"" for Wall Street Journal and then follow the prompts there. Does this help?
12:18:58 - Barry Zaslow : I can ask the business librarians Zac and Abi to send you a direct link if there is one if you provide your e-mail address, though.

Can you tell me more about what it is you need?
19:18:05 - Patron : final draft 4 book
19:20:40 - Barry Zaslow : I do not see this title in our collection or OhioLINK. Is it a textbook you are supposed to buy or rent? These would be through the bookstore at <a href=""https://miamioh.ecampus.com/"" target=""_blank"">https://miamioh.ecampus.com/</a>. Does this help?
19:25:43 - Barry Zaslow : You might reach out to your professor tomorrow to see if this is something you need for class. Also, you could check with the Howe Writing Center during the day at <a href=""https://miamioh.edu/hcwe/hwc/"" target=""_blank"">https://miamioh.edu/hcwe/hwc/</a> as they might have copies or something similar to that title
19:29:23 - Barry Zaslow : I also searched the authors in our catalog and OhioLINK but did not see anything. The 2022 edition appears to be available for purchase at Amazon but it is a bit costly at $70 so I can see why you might want to rent it or get it from a library.
19:31:05 - Barry Zaslow : Here is a link to the Miami bookstore record for the Final Draft 4 title: <a href=""https://miamioh.ecampus.com/final-draft-4-student-lambert-jeanne/bk/9781107495586"" target=""_blank"">https://miamioh.ecampus.com/final-draft-4-student-lambert-jeanne/bk/9781107495586</a>. It looks like their cost is $76 but the rental is half at $38.
19:34:44 - Patron : price is for ebook or copy book
19:36:42 - Barry Zaslow : I think the rental is for a paper textbook as it says etextbook is not available but I'm absolutely sure. Here is a link to their contact page as well: <a href=""https://miamihelp.ecampus.com/hc/en-us"" target=""_blank"">https://miamihelp.ecampus.com/hc/en-us</a>
19:37:47 - Barry Zaslow : The libraries and the bookstore are not connected at all so I'm just going by what I see in their online information.

19:58:12 - Barry Zaslow : As I have not heard back from you for over 20 minutes I'm going to close the chat now. Hope this helps you get to the book.

I was told in my Roman Civilization course that our required text was set to be held in the library for students to use and make copies of required readings.

Can you tell me the course number? I might be able to determine it from that but it would help to have at least an idea of the title or author.

20:22:25 - Patron : The book is about the history of it
20:22:34 - Barry Zaslow : OK. Let me check. Please hold on.
20:26:22 - Barry Zaslow : Is the professor Zara Torlone? There is a title called A brief history of the Romans which is at the main desk of King Library. It should be available tonight till 1am (it was used earlier today so I'm assuming that's the right title--the other on for this class are about specific poets like Virgil, Ovid, and Suetonius)
20:27:51 - Patron : Yes, that is it! All I had was ""A brief history"" so I couldn't see that being any help to search as a title. I'll definitely pop over to king to snag it. Is the book able to be checked out or only kept in the library?
20:28:23 - Barry Zaslow : It says no overnight so I assume that means in library use only for scanning, photocopying or reading until the library closes.
20:29:01 - Patron : Alright, thank you for the assistance! That's all I needed. Have a great rest of your night!

14:33:20 - Patron : Ohh
14:33:48 - Patron : Can we get back that 2018 edition?
14:35:50 - Barry Zaslow : I can't do that on chat but you can call King Circulation at 513-529-4141 and ask them to recall it. It might not get back right away, though. You could also ask your professor if they can put a copy of the book on reserve at King or a regional campus if you are there if this is a textbook as we do have a textbooks on reserve program so more people could use it for a limited time in the library. Does this help?

1. CC-BY
2. CC-BY-NC
Note that CC-BY-NC-ND would be something that I would like to exclude. 

Is there a way to do this on Web of Science?","","26","","09:17:19 - Kristen Adams : Interesting question - let me think
09:17:43 - Kristen Adams : I think in Web of Science you can filter if they were published open access
09:17:47 - Kristen Adams : I'm sure you can
09:18:12 - Kristen Adams : but I'm not sure about searching for these specific licenses
09:18:21 - Kristen Adams : Let me go to Web of Science and see
09:20:17 - Kristen Adams : I'm not seeing how to do that in Web of Science
09:20:32 - Kristen Adams : It does indeed have the different levels of open access, eg. green or gold
09:20:44 - Kristen Adams : and I tried with the first journal, 

 Journal of Quality Technology
09:21:05 - Kristen Adams : you can search by journal title to get results for everything in that journal, then filter it
09:22:12 - Kristen Adams : The Journal Citation Reports, within Web of Science also came to mind
09:22:22 - Kristen Adams : you can get all kinds of stats about a journal there
09:22:52 - Kristen Adams : and again they have info on which level of open access they have, but not the specific licenses you mention
09:23:01 - Patron : None of these journals are open access by default, but some authors make their papers open-access (due to funding requirements or institutional requirements)
09:23:25 - Patron : Is there a way to may be export the license as part of the results?

My name is Lena. I am the secretary of the Memory and Learning Club here at Miami. We were wondering if we could host an event sometime this semester. The goal would be to teach the members of the club about the resources at King, and ideally we would like to have someone from King show us around and help explain different resources. I understand if this is not possible, but we figured we would reach out in order to try helping our club the best we can! Whenever possible, please let me know if and when this is possible.

Thank you so much for your time!","","7","","19:35:22 - Stefanie Hilles : Hi Lena. We do often give tours but events are a little more challenging. Usually these are classified under instruction and the request would go to the subject liaison. What kind of topics does the club cover?

19:46:05 - Patron : We help to teach about memory and learning techniques, as well as how to effectively study. At the moment we are targeting students from more intensive courses, such as the sciences or math classes. If an event cannot happen, is there a way to schedule a tour for the club the focuses on areas that would be more helpful for our purposes? Or even just a short meeting with a staff member? I assume we would have to reach out to that person personally, but I am not sure who would be best to speak to.
19:49:04 - Stefanie Hilles : Yes. We often do tours. I would recommend reaching out to, probably, <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/prf.php?account_id=8220"">Laura Birkenhauer</a>. She is our Student Success Librarian for Student Engagement.

13:17:44 - Zachary Grisham : Since I have not heard from you in a while I am about to disconnect. Feel free to email both of those folks though, they will be able to help you on the topic and please reach out via chat if the library can help with anything else!

17:04:55 - Katie Gibson : lib.miamioh.edu
17:05:08 - Katie Gibson : and then on that main search box, choose the ejournals tab
17:05:15 - Katie Gibson : and search Harvard Business Review

17:05:47 - Patron : so then I just select any database?
17:06:01 - Katie Gibson : exactly
17:06:19 - Katie Gibson : make sure the coverage dates are in the range of what you need
17:06:23 - Katie Gibson : but pick the database

Just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something. I might be able to access some of those through the Cincinnati library. i'll explore it. Thank you!
14:17:46 - Patron : Sorry, ** definitely NOT a big deal
14:19:48 - Barry Zaslow : That's OK. I usually use ""prof"" as a courtesy when I check the name in our circulation system so as not to use a first name for someone who is not known to me and is indeed on the faculty. You could also check with any of the librarians at Hamilton or Middletown to see if they could subscribe separately (although we are trying to be better about making sure all Miami patrons have the same privileges)
14:20:51 - Patron : Good tip. I may stop by later today and ask. Thank you, I appreciate the help, Barry!
14:21:09 - Barry Zaslow : You're welcome. Have a great afternoon.
14:21:13 - Patron : Same!

15:16:50 - Patron : Okay, thank you for checking on this. I'll look through the list.
15:17:18 - Mark Dahlquist : It might be helpful to consider broadening this search, using terms such as wildlife management, citizen science, or looking at particular wildlife health management issues (species, etc).<br />
15:17:38 - Patron : I'll do that as well. Thank you for these tips!
15:17:58 - Mark Dahlquist : You're welcome! I would also recommend trying out the ""Google Scholar"" tab on the library homepage.<br />

Again, this is not my field of expertise, however, since this looks like an original research article, then I believe it is a primary source for science

14:09:17 - Laura Birkenhauer : You'll use the full URL, including the ""http"" or ""https"" part. Https is just more secure than Http.

09:53:13 - Patron : OK
10:08:16 - Patron : Hi I'm still struggling to find at least 6 more article about this topic
10:09:45 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I wonder if other keywords you could try could be: health effects, emotions, health
10:10:02 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I might try a search like ""pet ownership and (health or emotions or health effects)
10:10:16 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Is there information you are looking for more specifically? 
10:11:06 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I see another term ""psychological factors""
10:11:23 - Patron : articles with "" Pet "" and "" Mood "" in them
10:12:39 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Here are search results for pet and mood: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=psyh&amp;bquery=pet+and+mood&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=psyh&amp;bquery=pet+and+mood&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a>
10:13:25 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Sometimes it is helpful to use other keywords since authors don't always use the same terms to describe similar ideas
10:13:34 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I think emotions or psychology could be helpful

14:25:29 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, I understand! You could search using the library search tool using those keywords. It will give you quite a few articles

14:25:33 - Zachary Grisham : That is the search
14:25:57 - Zachary Grisham : Then on the left you could limit it to Academic Journals.
14:26:54 - Zachary Grisham : However, you might want to be a bit more specific. Say if you were looking for if owning a pet was correlated with better moods in owners than those who do not own pets.
14:27:41 - Zachary Grisham : You could then use more specific keywords to find articles that likely fit with your interests a bit more.
14:28:03 - Patron : im a little confused
14:28:15 - Zachary Grisham : No worries, I will try to be more clear. 
14:28:56 - Patron : ok thank you
14:29:25 - Zachary Grisham : So, with a blanket statement of an assignment related to the relationship between mood and pets might go over a few different subject areas and give you information about pet moods. 
14:29:46 - Zachary Grisham : If you were looking specifically how pet ownership affects mood in the owners.
14:30:03 - Zachary Grisham : Then focused only on psychology resources you would find more specific information.
14:30:08 - Zachary Grisham : Does that make sense?
14:32:29 - Patron : ok thanks.....
14:33:07 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, was there something specific you wished to know about pets and moods? 
14:33:33 - Patron : Im just looking for 3 more articles related to pets and moods
14:34:10 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, if you wanted to use more general articles I would suggest using google scholar then.

The equipment is all handled by the circulation areas at King or whichever library you are nearest (Hamilton, Middletown, etc.) You can call King if you are in Oxford at 513-529-4141. I don't know if they reserve cameras ahead of time but it doesn't hurt to ask.

11:02:39 - Barry Zaslow : You can also stop by the desk if you are on campus. They are open 7am-1am every day during the semester except for university holidays and breaks.

It's in Databases A-Z on the library home page under Cincinnati Enquirer (2010-3 months ago)? Do you need multiple sources or would articles from there suffice?

13:33:39 - Barry Zaslow : There's also Newspaper Source which indexes the Dayton Daily News. That might be a bit far afield but if there was any *controversy* in Wyoming it might have made it into their site. This is in the Databases A-Z under N right near Nexis Uni.

12:52:32 - Laura Birkenhauer : Great! 
12:52:34 - Patron : One more question please
12:52:40 - Laura Birkenhauer : Sure, how can I help?
12:53:49 - Patron : AI Integration into higher education curricula in African countries. AI technologies impact teaching methodologies, student engagement, and learning outcomes
12:57:02 - Laura Birkenhauer : OK, so I'd recommend breaking down this very complex topic into a series of smaller searches. Let me try a search and send you an example.
12:57:31 - Patron : ok.
12:59:00 - Laura Birkenhauer : You could try, for example, the same search I performed earlier, but add additional keywords to find articles related to curriculum: 

(""Artificial intelligence"" OR AI) AND africa AND (""higher education"" OR college OR university) AND (curricula OR curriculum)

12:59:28 - Patron : ok
12:59:38 - Laura Birkenhauer : You can try something similar for the other topics your interested in. 
12:59:45 - Laura Birkenhauer : By the way, what class is this for?
12:59:57 - Laura Birkenhauer : I can suggest a library guide that may have further relevant resources. 
13:00:35 - Patron : Personal research
13:01:07 - Patron : Thank you
13:02:00 - Laura Birkenhauer : OK! Just thought I'd ask in case I could share further resources. Here is the Education library guide. Abi Morgan and Jaclyn Spraetz are the librarians for this area, they can always meet with you for an in-depth consultation if you need further help.

13:02:39 - Patron : Great! Thank you
13:02:48 - Laura Birkenhauer : You're very welcome!
13:03:32 - Patron : Is there any librarian consultant in IT or Information Systems?
13:04:37 - Laura Birkenhauer : Roger Justus would be the person to talk to! Here is his Information Systems &amp; Analytics guide: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/ISA"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/ISA</a>
13:04:52 - Laura Birkenhauer : Roger also happens to be part of a group of librarians who've been working on AI related research projects

15:23:28 - Patron : so I'm not sure if that's an issue
15:24:03 - Jenny Presnell : As a staff member you should have access. Alums don't-- most of our contracts with database providers say current students, faculty and staff

17:33:38 - Katie Gibson : ok, one moment, let me find an example
17:33:38 - Patron : I was thinking....
17:34:44 - Patron : Untitled. Fall 2017. Commes des Garcons. Vogue Runway
17:34:53 - Katie Gibson : Here's how APA says you should cite images: <a href=""https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples#audiovisual-media"" target=""_blank"">https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples#audiovisual-media</a>
17:34:54 - Patron : not untitled, but unknown
17:36:23 - Katie Gibson : the photo credit says a name in the bottom right corner, so that person should be in the citation
17:36:38 - Katie Gibson : one moment, i'm looking with another librarian to see how this should go
17:37:45 - Katie Gibson : Ok, so APA says when there is no title, add a brief description (so in this case maybe something like 5/18 in Comme des Garçons or something like that)
17:39:43 - Katie Gibson : But the photographer should still be listed first, so put Arnold, Kim Weston (2017) first. Because there is also a date on it, and those go in the parenthesis. You don't need the fall part. 
17:41:09 - Katie Gibson : This is the general format to follow: Author. (Year). <i>Description in italics</i> [format - so in this case, photograph]. Website name. URL
17:43:41 - Patron : Where do you see Arnold, Kim Weston?
17:43:54 - Katie Gibson : It's in the very bottom right corner of the website
17:44:22 - Katie Gibson : In little white letters it says: Photo: Kim Weston Arnold / Indigital.tv
17:44:50 - Patron : maybe its covered by the little banner at the bottom wanting me to buy vogure
17:44:59 - Katie Gibson : Definitely possible

09:19:31 - Nate Floyd : I just sent a note to our business librarian to ask if there's a technical problem with Marketline, or if there's some kind of workaround.
09:25:56 - Nate Floyd : OK, it sounds like we have an outage
09:25:57 - Patron : boultotj@miamioh.edu
09:26:08 - Nate Floyd : I am reporting this to our systems folks
09:26:23 - Nate Floyd : Is there any chance the info you need might be in another database we could find?
09:26:29 - Patron : Sorry, got tied up with a student. Thanks for the information. We'll check back later.
09:26:51 - Nate Floyd : Hope to have it fixed soon-ish :)

What is self regulation?
17:33:40 - Zachary Grisham : Are you still there?
17:36:41 - Zachary Grisham : Well, I can answer information about the data either way. Statista has tons of data on parents and parenting and is broken down by country.

17:37:43 - Patron : Hi, I am still here.  Self-regulation is probably found in social science or psychology journals (maybe).
17:38:09 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, can you access the first link?
17:38:33 - Patron : I found this on the web---Self-regulation is the ability to understand and manage your behaviour and your reactions to feelings and things happening around you.
17:39:12 - Patron : Thanks, Zachary.  I am a doctoral student in EDL and I am working on my comps.
17:39:48 - Zachary Grisham : Ahh, good to know! 
17:40:06 - Zachary Grisham : It looks like this is an extremely popular topic.
17:40:17 - Zachary Grisham : One moment while I get the results ready for you.
17:40:59 - Zachary Grisham : It looks like there is quite a bit in springer and sage journals
17:42:04 - Zachary Grisham : Are you interested in all self regulation or only in articles that have to do with families/parenting.
17:42:13 - Zachary Grisham : ?
17:43:47 - Zachary Grisham : I was looking through our search and comparing it to google scholar, I think google scholar might be a good place to start on this. 
17:44:11 - Zachary Grisham : If you are logged into Miami University it will then allow you to access all articles available here.
17:44:21 - Zachary Grisham : Search that pulled up quite a bit.

17:45:01 - Zachary Grisham : Note that the majority relating to families in this search are available via sage or springer.
17:46:44 - Zachary Grisham : Access to pdf are accessible via the right link.
17:47:32 - Zachary Grisham : For example.

17:51:55 - Patron : Thank you
17:52:11 - Zachary Grisham : You are welcome! Is that enough information?
17:53:37 - Patron : I hope so. There are some articles in the journal of marriage and family review. Does Miami have a subscription that journal?

17:55:29 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, there should be some information on that. I thought we were focusing on china
17:56:24 - Zachary Grisham : Use taylor &amp; francis to access it.
17:56:42 - Zachary Grisham : It has coverage from the 80s until the present
17:58:14 - Patron : Ok. Interesting that there are quite a few studies for China.  I am reading those as well to see if there are findings that are applicable to other family conexts.
17:58:27 - Patron : That should be contexts not conexts.  LOL
17:58:59 - Zachary Grisham : No worries, I assumed that is what you meant!

It is possible to loan via ILL or OhioLink DVD's? There are DVD's I would like to gain access for a course that I'm teaching next semester.","","5","","11:03:38 - Barry Zaslow : Hello. Each university has different policies regarding whether they lend DVDs but it's worth trying OhioLINK or ILL for specific titles. We also have several video streaming services such as Kanopy and Swank which are listed in Databases A-Z where you can search for titles. Does this help?
11:05:59 - Patron : okay thanks. having a title in the databases you own does not stop me from requesting the same title on a DVD?
11:07:49 - Barry Zaslow : You should be able to request a DVD if you would like to use that format since neither OhioLINK nor Interlibrary Loan will search online streaming to compare with your request. If you need to order a title to purchase you can contact the subject librarian for your area--I think that would be Katie Gibson for any language/cultural studies for Europe or East Asia or the Americas. She's at gibsonke@miamioh.edu

14:13:37 - Patron : That is perfect.  Thank you!
14:13:44 - Jaclyn Spraetz : You're welcome! 
14:15:05 - Jaclyn Spraetz : It looks like students can also access the archives directly through the New York Times website. They can set up free accounts using their Miami unique ID
14:16:11 - Patron : Is there a way that I can embed in Canvas a hyperlink to a specific set of NYT search results?
14:16:39 - Patron : I want my students to look at coverage of ""Armenia"" between April 1, 1915, and December 31, 1916.
14:17:25 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Here is a search I tried using the NYT website: <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&amp;endDate=1916-12-31&amp;query=armenia&amp;sort=best&amp;startDate=1915-01-01"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&amp;endDate=1916-12-31&amp;query=armenia&amp;sort=best&amp;startDate=1915-01-01</a>
14:17:32 - Patron : I've tried just doing the search myself and then embedding the URL, but students tell me that this does not work.
14:17:58 - Jaclyn Spraetz : You can also do the search in the database link I shared: <a href=""https://www.proquest.com/hnpnewyorktimes/results/D6691115C5BD449FPQ/1?accountid=12434"" target=""_blank"">https://www.proquest.com/hnpnewyorktimes/results/D6691115C5BD449FPQ/1?accountid=12434</a>
14:18:26 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Was it the link directly from the New York Times or a different link? 
14:19:00 - Jaclyn Spraetz : It you shared a URL from the New York Times directly, I wonder if it is because they haven't set up an account
14:19:42 - Patron : That's what I did for my students, and they experienced what I just experienced when I clicked on the above link:  a ""Session Ended"" message.
14:20:18 - Jaclyn Spraetz : What about this link? <a href=""http://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/search/2570906?accountid=12434"" target=""_blank"">http://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/search/2570906?accountid=12434</a>
14:20:40 - Patron : That worked!
14:20:49 - Patron : And then I just have them narrow the dates themselves?
14:21:25 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Let me try to limit the dates and I will share a new link in just a moment
14:22:35 - Jaclyn Spraetz : How about this?: <a href=""http://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/search/2570908?accountid=12434"" target=""_blank"">http://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/search/2570908?accountid=12434</a>
14:22:47 - Jaclyn Spraetz : The dates included are 4/1/1915 - 12/31/1916
14:24:08 - Patron : That worked!
14:24:11 - Jaclyn Spraetz : If you need to use a different search the best way to save a link is to go to ""save search/alert"" above the results on the right-hand side and then click on ""get search link""
14:24:14 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Okay great! 
14:24:45 - Patron : My students tell me, though, that the link only seems to work for a limited time, and then they get a ""Session Ended"" message. Is there a time limit on search results?
14:25:30 - Jaclyn Spraetz : When I copied the search link, I received the message ""This search link will expire in one year [2025-03-05]"" so hopefully it stays good until then! 
14:27:09 - Patron : OK, I'll give it a try!
14:27:24 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Great! Feel free to circle back if you have any other questions!

There are very few libraries that still have this publication so I am having a hard time finding access.","","8","","10:07:18 - Nate Floyd : Hi Lindsey! Sorry, swamped over here.

11:23:42 - Patron : Well, I apprecaite that, but we need to access it a lot to curate articles for the CTE News. I have not had this problem until now. I guess we may have to purchase a subscription.

13:12:50 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I would be happy to look. Since it is so specific it might be more difficult to find sources specifically talking about mental health at Miami University. You might need look more generally at mental health and universities. I'm sure you can still talk about resources specific to Miami University that they provide information on through their websites
13:13:19 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I wonder if there might be articles in the Miami Student
13:14:01 - Patron : Ok! I'll look into it further, I never considered discussing other universities and connecting it to our own, so that's a good idea. Thank you! I don't think you need to do the research for me, I'll look into the Miami Student and other university mental health sources.
13:14:56 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Okay that sounds good! It would probably be a good idea to supplement your research with what you can find specific to Miami University, but also look into some academic articles that talk about mental health at universities more broadly

There’s a potentially long story I could tell, but the short version is this: I’m trying to locate a historical periodical titled “American Monthly” which would have been publishing between 1859 and 1861. In my search, I stumbled online upon this document produced by EBSCO, I presume to advertise what’s covered in one of their databases: https://www.ebsco.com/m/ee/Marketing/titleLists/aml-coverage.pdf

In that online document, I’m interested in the entries for “American Monthly, The,” 1859 and 1860. My question for you is: Do you know if Miami’s libraries subscribe to an EBSCO database that includes that historical periodical? The online EBSCO document is titled “American Literary Periodicals, 1859-1891,” but Miami doesn’t appear to subscribe to a database with that title, or at least I don’t see it in our A-Z list of databases.","","5","","16:20:57 - Stefanie Hilles : If you go to the library's home page, you can look up the title of the journal in the e-journals tab to see if we have online access.

15:48:33 - Mark Dahlquist : Hi, thanks for this question. I'll happy to find some sources on this. I'll start by finding some peer reviewed research articles.<br />
15:48:41 - Mark Dahlquist : Hold on one moment, please.<br />
15:48:43 - Patron : thank you so much!!!
15:48:51 - Patron : appreciate the help
15:50:21 - Mark Dahlquist : Here is an initial list of peer-reviewed journal articles, limited to articles focusing on the United Stated: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;bquery=policing&amp;cli0=RV&amp;clv0=Y&amp;cli1=FT1&amp;clv1=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;bquery=policing&amp;cli0=RV&amp;clv0=Y&amp;cli1=FT1&amp;clv1=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site</a><br />
15:51:19 - Mark Dahlquist : From this list, you can add search terms to the second box such as bias, tactics, or tools to narrow these hits to your research interests.<br />
15:51:54 - Mark Dahlquist : (By the way I created this list by searching in the ""Articles and More"" tab on the library homescreen)<br />
15:53:19 - Mark Dahlquist : Another search tool I would recommend for this subject is a database called Statista, which is available at this link: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/statista"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/statista</a><br />
15:53:47 - Mark Dahlquist : I would suggest opening that link in a new window and searching policing for statistics and visualizations on this question.<br />
15:55:49 - Mark Dahlquist : Are these types of resources the kind of sources you are looking for?<br />
15:57:10 - Patron : Nothing comes up when I search keywords such as ""modern day policing"" and ""race""
15:59:41 - Mark Dahlquist : Hmm, here's an example of a search in Articles and more for ""policing"" adding ""race"" with the AND funciton: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;bquery=policing+AND+race&amp;cli0=FT1&amp;clv0=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;bquery=policing+AND+race&amp;cli0=FT1&amp;clv0=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site</a><br />
16:00:25 - Mark Dahlquist : Some keywords might work better than others, ""modern day policing"" might be a little too informal.<br />
16:02:21 - Mark Dahlquist : We also have books on policing, which can be useful in providing a broader view of this topic: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip,url,uid,cpid&amp;custid=s9002934&amp;bquery=policing&amp;cli0=DT1&amp;clv0=200501-202412&amp;cli1=FT1&amp;clv1=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=And&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;profile=eds_cat"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip,url,uid,cpid&amp;custid=s9002934&amp;bquery=policing&amp;cli0=DT1&amp;clv0=200501-202412&amp;cli1=FT1&amp;clv1=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=And&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;profile=eds_cat</a><br />

What are the challenges and opportunities faced by individuals growing up in multilingual households in terms of navigating their cultural identity and linguistic heritage? and lastly 3.

12:10:37 - Barry Zaslow : I believe she said you would have to divide the question into three parts if I understand what was going on--addressing each separately and then using what you find to perhaps narrow it down?
12:11:15 - Patron : yes she sent me a two sources for the first part but then I got discconnectd and didnt get to finish the rest
12:13:17 - Patron : hi also when Im click into resources on the miami database library when one of the resources isn't a website or journal but its a book, how do i accessit
12:14:28 - Barry Zaslow : So you were working with Articles and More on the library home page. That is the broadest search so it should produce some results using a variety of keywords. For books you can copy and paste the book title into our ""books and more"" search to see if we own it. If not and it's something you really want to use you can then try OhioLINK (there is a blue link to that on the library home page as well near the search box) and request it from another school.
12:15:08 - Patron : ok thank you
12:15:46 - Barry Zaslow : Let me see what we have for part 3 of the question now, the Greek culture area.
12:18:09 - Patron : ok
12:21:00 - Barry Zaslow : It looks like you might get some results using keywords ""Greek"" ""cultural"" and ""monolingual"" or ""multilingual"" in articles and more. I would also suggest limiting to English language results (unless you want foreign titles) as there are some in French and German which don't seem that relevant. I didn't get any matches using ""Greek churches"" though
12:23:37 - Barry Zaslow : The 2nd question also produced some results using ""multilingual households"" and ""cultural identity"" as phrases to combine in Articles and More keyword search. You probably will see titles that seem useful to you and others not so much.
12:24:30 - Patron : ok thank you so much
12:28:46 - Barry Zaslow : You're welcome. Does this give you a start in being able to combine/narrow down your queries? It might take a bit of digging and trying a few other keywords if the results aren't optimal. There are different people here each three hours with varying expertise, too.
12:30:16 - Patron : yes thank you so much for helping me!!
12:32:12 - Barry Zaslow : Sure. It sounds like an intriguing project. Don't hesitate to reach out later if you need more assistance.

12:45:10 - Laura Birkenhauer : Great! If you'd like even more, you can also do a search in the Articles &amp; More tab (on our homepage, lib.miamioh.edu) for search terms like communication AND pharmacists and you should get a number of relevant results.

My sample search produced some results but you would know better which titles might be useful for you. You can also limit to years (perhaps the last five) and language.

Here is an e-book that appears to have a chapter about Englewood, too: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/muohio-ebooks/detail.action?docID=4792701"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/muohio-ebooks/detail.action?docID=4792701</a>
13:43:35 - Barry Zaslow : The databases NexisUni and Factiva in Databases A-Z might be good places to start for local news from Chicago. You can put in keywords such as violence and the city name and limit by date range.
13:44:27 - Patron : I have an assignment where I need to find 8 different sources and my teacher said that they could be any type. So as far as what type I am not super picky. I will check out those sources above! Thank you very much for the help!
13:44:48 - Barry Zaslow : There might be some useful articles in Criminal Justice Abstracts with Full Text as well since the Chicago situation has been ongoing (unfortunately) for a number of years.
13:45:22 - Barry Zaslow : These last could examine the topic from both sides, too, although I didn't check myself on what is there.
13:50:11 - Barry Zaslow : Definitely limit by date range there and maybe other criteria as even the last 10 years produced hundreds of matches. You could also narrow down the topic if it's too much to deal with saying ""police violence"" or ""gang violence"" or whatever else you think is useful
14:06:02 - Barry Zaslow : As I have not heard back from you in 15 minutes I'm going to close the chat window. There will be different people here every three hours 9am-9pm through Thursday an thru 5pm Friday.

13:36:38 - Zachary Grisham : Alright, I am back. Unfortunately, we do not have access to that streaming service through the library. I am unaware if other departments grant access to current students but I would guess no due to the announcement by Miami Athletics. <a href=""https://miamiredhawks.com/news/2024/2/29/miami-athletics-announces-streaming-coverage-of-baseball-and-softball.aspx"" target=""_blank"">https://miamiredhawks.com/news/2024/2/29/miami-athletics-announces-streaming-coverage-of-baseball-and-softball.aspx</a>

17:03:30 - Stefanie Hilles : Here are the results I got using articles and more: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;bquery=declining+enrollment+AND+(+college+or+university+or+higher+education+)+AND+(+Money+OR+budget+)&amp;cli0=FT1&amp;clv0=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;bquery=declining+enrollment+AND+(+college+or+university+or+higher+education+)+AND+(+Money+OR+budget+)&amp;cli0=FT1&amp;clv0=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site</a>
17:03:38 - Stefanie Hilles : Do those look like they would be helpful?
17:05:00 - Patron : Yes I think I can find useful information! Thanks. Just confirming all those sources are peer reviewed?
17:05:36 - Stefanie Hilles : Not all of them. You can limit to peer reviewed articles on the left side of the page
17:07:14 - Patron : Gotcha. Thanks for your help
17:07:26 - Stefanie Hilles : No problem! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
17:07:38 - Patron : No thank you
17:07:44 - Stefanie Hilles : Have a nice day!

10:56:11 - Patron : Qualitative approach:
For our qualitative research we decided to hold a focus group where we could speak to a
group of our target audience to understand their relationship with the museum.
In this document we listed the 10 people who will be attending the focus group. We selected a
range of first year students that live in different areas on campus, are studying different majors,
and are involved in different extracurricular activities, so we can have a broad perspective of first
year student’s relationship with the art museum.
The focus group will be held on zoom for student’s convenience on April 7th at 5 pm.
Below you will find the questions we will ask the students during the focus group. We will have
one group member designated to ask the questions while the rest of us will be taking notes on the
discussion.
Quantitative approach:
For our quantitative research we created a survey that we sent out to around 40 first year
students. We asked statistical questions in order to understand their existing knowledge of the art
museum. We wanted to have numerical data that we could include in our research to help the
client better understand the market we are targeting and gaps in the relationship between them
and the museum.

19:47:14 - Zachary Grisham : For example, what class is it for?
19:47:22 - Patron : Hi Zachary,
19:48:08 - Patron : Yes, I am currently enrolled in Bio 306A, Horticulture and  I am researching apples for a plant profile project.
19:48:38 - Zachary Grisham : That is really cool, never heard of this before but I am betting ScienceDirect might be our friend for this type of researc. 
19:48:41 - Zachary Grisham : research
19:48:46 - Zachary Grisham : Have you used that database before?
19:48:53 - Patron : I have done research on other areas related to apples before, but I am struggling to find stuff on propagation methods
19:49:10 - Zachary Grisham : No worries, we will find something on it!
19:49:19 - Patron : I don't believe I have, I will check it out!
19:49:29 - Zachary Grisham : Give me a moment and I can get it for you.
19:49:36 - Patron : Thank you!
19:50:55 - Zachary Grisham : So this is ScienceDirect
19:50:56 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/sciencedirect"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/sciencedirect</a>
19:51:22 - Zachary Grisham : However, I could not find too much. Might be a job for Google Scholar so we can figure out where these articles tend to be published.
19:51:24 - Zachary Grisham : One moment.
19:51:40 - Zachary Grisham : Alright, that worked. <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C36&amp;q=apple+propagation+methods&amp;btnG="" target=""_blank"">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C36&amp;q=apple+propagation+methods&amp;btnG=</a>
19:52:09 - Zachary Grisham : So, this can be a fun resource because of the tools that are included.
19:52:18 - Zachary Grisham : Especially the related articles and cited sections.
19:53:08 - Patron : Thank you so much! Yes, the google scholar options appear to be closer to what I am looking for.
19:54:18 - Zachary Grisham : You are welcome! Have you used the related articles feature?
19:54:54 - Patron : I have not. Is that unique to google scholar?
19:55:50 - Zachary Grisham : Nope, but I find it to be a really useful function. For example this article focuses on quality of apple trees by method of propogation.
19:55:51 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://bibliotekanauki.pl/articles/11542524"" target=""_blank"">https://bibliotekanauki.pl/articles/11542524</a>
19:56:00 - Zachary Grisham : This is the related articles function
19:56:11 - Patron : Oh, I see.
19:56:16 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:grM64jqVtFUJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;scioq=apple+propagation+methods&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,36"" target=""_blank"">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=related:grM64jqVtFUJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;scioq=apple+propagation+methods&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,36</a>
19:56:34 - Zachary Grisham : It is directly below the different articles, next to the cited articles function.
19:57:38 - Patron : Ah. I don't think I have paid much attention to that, I'll be sure to now,
19:58:01 - Zachary Grisham : Is micropropagation the same thing? If so, this is a review article on the topic.
19:58:02 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975010000285"" target=""_blank"">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975010000285</a>
19:58:26 - Patron : How can I determine if articles o google scholar peer reviewed?
19:59:06 - Zachary Grisham : Very good question! The idea is to use google scholar to figure out where the articles come from. Once we find the databases where most are stored in we can use that database to make sure they are peer reviewed. 
19:59:07 - Patron : Thank, it is a little different, but I believe it would supplement my section to have information on that as well.
19:59:54 - Zachary Grisham : For example, the last article I sent was from Science direct. It actually has a limiter for peer reviewed. 
20:01:25 - Zachary Grisham : Using that we can then use the keywords attributed to that article In vitro"" ""Malus sp.""  ""Shoot multiplication"" ""Rooting"" ""Production of propagation materials""to figure out where articles similar to it might be while using that limiter. 
20:01:50 - Zachary Grisham : You could also just visit the website of the journal it is published in. That will tell you if it is peer-reviewed but much more time consuming. 
20:02:20 - Patron : Ah, okay.
20:03:02 - Patron : I know some of the other websites have limiters and you can enter keywords
20:03:26 - Patron : I think I was just failing to enter the correct keywords
20:03:30 - Zachary Grisham : Yep! Most databases will have peer-reviewed limiters.
20:03:48 - Patron : Cool.
20:03:49 - Zachary Grisham : That is common though, once you find the right keywords research gets a lot easier. 
20:04:05 - Patron : Yeah, I am sure.
20:05:18 - Zachary Grisham : Well, the resource were not perfect but if you would like I could try and find other databases that might have content.
20:06:26 - Patron : Sure, if you don't. I know Grafting is a popular propagation method
20:07:36 - Zachary Grisham : I do not mind. I am surprised I was unable to find much, it has made me curious why I am failing. Btw, if I keep failing Ginny Boehme is our Biology librarian, she would definitely be worth reaching out to. Her contact information is here. 
20:07:37 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/biology"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/biology</a>
20:09:01 - Patron : Oh no! It is a bit of a comfort to know I am not the only one who struggles with this. I am actually familiar with her, she came to talk to our class the other day about how to research this project
20:09:22 - Zachary Grisham : I wonder did she show you Web of Science? 
20:09:33 - Zachary Grisham : It looks promising but I am a business fellow so I cannot be sure. 
20:09:46 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/summary/1a1e3e7d-3ba3-4642-a527-ca8465448c97-d7653c3e/relevance/1"" target=""_blank"">https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/summary/1a1e3e7d-3ba3-4642-a527-ca8465448c97-d7653c3e/relevance/1</a>
20:10:08 - Patron : Yes she did.
20:10:23 - Patron : I was actually using some of the databases she recommended
20:11:11 - Patron : I did not try web of science for this precise topic but I'll try it as well.
20:11:25 - Zachary Grisham : Would this be a good article?
20:11:26 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000345309800023"" target=""_blank"">https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/full-record/WOS:000345309800023</a>
20:12:01 - Zachary Grisham : If so, it looks like web of science has an entire category/section on horticulture.
20:12:53 - Patron : I am not sure how to access that link it won't offer miami as an institution
20:13:24 - Zachary Grisham : Ahh, must be taking you through the wrong route. If you can log into Web of science I will give you the title.
20:14:12 - Zachary Grisham : let me get you web of science link.
20:14:31 - Patron : I was able to get into web of science
20:14:36 - Zachary Grisham : Ok good.
20:14:39 - Zachary Grisham : Here is the title.
20:15:05 - Zachary Grisham : Studies on vegetative propagation of custard apple<br />
20:16:52 - Patron : Is it the article with first author Kumar, J?
20:17:11 - Zachary Grisham : Yep! That is it
20:17:55 - Patron : Cool.
20:17:56 - Zachary Grisham : Are apples of the annonaceous plant species?
20:18:07 - Zachary Grisham : I found a review on propagation of those.
20:18:23 - Patron : I am actually not familiar with that term.
20:18:52 - Zachary Grisham : It gave these as examples
20:18:53 - Zachary Grisham : soursop, custard apple, atemoya and cherimoya
20:19:15 - Zachary Grisham : Not sure the difference between a custard apple and an apple though.
20:19:26 - Patron : I wonder if custard apple is a variety like  crab apple ...
20:20:06 - Zachary Grisham : Just looked it up looks nothing like it.
20:20:31 - Patron : hah, yes, I did too. It appears to be related to pawpaws
20:20:43 - Patron : Interesting.
20:22:05 - Zachary Grisham : What about a book?
20:22:26 - Patron : Would a book be harder to access immediattely?
20:22:46 - Patron : It would also have to be a primary source
20:23:17 - Zachary Grisham : That is an important distinction, no a book would not be helpful then. 
20:23:35 - Patron : Yeah. I appreciate the suggestion, though!
20:24:24 - Patron : I think with all the resources you have shared I'll be able to find what I need.
20:25:00 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, sorry I was not more helpful! Definitely reach out to Ginny, she will know more about the topic. Can I help you with anything else?
20:25:31 - Patron : On the contrary, you were a tremendous help!
20:26:09 - Patron : I believe that is all for now. Thank you again, and I will be sure to reach out to her, as well.
20:26:20 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, hope you have a good night!
20:26:30 - Patron : Thank you, I hope you do, too!

11:08:48 - Patron : The library website so I can access articles.
11:09:12 - Kristen Adams : Ok, are you a current student or faculty/staff?
11:09:14 - Patron : I keep getting (for days now) an error message that says Check if there is a typo in proxy.lib.miamioh.edu.
DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN
11:09:18 - Patron : student
11:09:38 - Kristen Adams : is this on campus, or off campus?
11:09:41 - Patron : off campus
11:10:09 - Kristen Adams : are you able to login to Canvas, and MyMiami?
11:10:13 - Patron : I am
11:10:25 - Kristen Adams : Ok
11:10:57 - Kristen Adams : If you sign into those, it should have you signed into the library as well, it's all the same
11:10:59 - Patron : I go to the library site through Canvas, and then click on the log-in at the top of the page
11:11:17 - Patron : and then I get that error message
11:11:43 - Kristen Adams : have you tried clearing cookies/cache, or an in-conginto window?
11:11:56 - Patron : I have not
11:12:23 - Kristen Adams : that might help,
11:12:49 - Patron : I recently had my entire computer cleared and reset. Would that even be an issue?
11:13:26 - Kristen Adams : also if you are going in through Canvas and having a problem, you might try going direct from our site - <a href=""https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/</a> (I know that it usually goes weird when people try to access our site via MyMiami)
11:13:45 - Kristen Adams : I'm not sure that your recent computer clear/reset would cause this
11:17:14 - Patron : going through that link shows a saved password but is saying it isn't recognized
11:18:06 - Kristen Adams : and you haven't changed your password recently?
11:18:13 - Patron : I have not
11:18:15 - Kristen Adams : ok
11:18:27 - Kristen Adams : let's try going directly into a database
11:18:31 - Kristen Adams : see if that works
11:18:50 - Kristen Adams : is there a certain one you needed, or we can pick a random one to try
11:18:52 - Kristen Adams : ?
11:20:19 - Patron : I have been trying to begin my research for our research paper so I am not sure. I was trying to start in Articles &amp; More
11:22:00 - Kristen Adams : Ok, no problem. Articles and More searches all the databases at once. As we are also trying to troubleshoot the login, let's try Academic Search Complete, it's a database with it's own specific link. So let's try this.

11:22:47 - Kristen Adams : if you are logged in to MyMiami, it should know that and not give you an issue, otherwise will prompt a login
11:23:08 - Patron : it just gave me the same error message
11:23:42 - Kristen Adams : the proxy one?
11:23:44 - Kristen Adams : proxy.lib.miamioh.edu. DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN
11:25:14 - Patron : yes
11:25:40 - Patron : and I cleared cookies already and nothing changed
11:27:37 - Kristen Adams : ok, sorry to hear.  I checked with another librarian for other suggestions, and they mentioned checking your security system's firewall, to see if it's blocking the site for some reason. 
11:27:48 - Kristen Adams : I can also take your email and report this to library IT
11:27:51 - Kristen Adams : see what they can do
11:28:04 - Kristen Adams : I'm not sure what else to try for now
11:28:48 - Patron : ok, let me check that
11:32:36 - Kristen Adams : also, if you are using a VPN, try turning that off
11:35:36 - Patron : I am not but this is going to take a while.
11:35:50 - Kristen Adams : ok, no problem
11:36:25 - Kristen Adams : I am glad to send in a ticket to library IT too, I'll need your email though to follow up
11:36:53 - Kristen Adams : I'll be here on chat till 12, then we change shifts, but someone will still be here
11:42:16 - Patron : email is granten2@miamioh.edu
11:47:34 - Kristen Adams : do you happen to be a new student?
11:54:50 - Kristen Adams : I checked with the staff at the circulation desk, and for some reason your unique ID is not in the library system. So that would be the root issue here.
11:55:41 - Kristen Adams : I will send in the ticket still to our IT, and see what they can do.
11:59:05 - Kristen Adams : While we are getting this figured out, if you are able to come to campus, then you can use the library computers to access our resources.
12:00:51 - Kristen Adams : I'm heading off, but I'm going to transfer you to Ginny, in case you have other questions
12:01:00 - Kristen Adams : I'll let you know what I hear from IT.

14:18:34 - Barry Zaslow : The authors in your excerpt both write for the Wall Street Journal so it's possible it is from that publication (the ""heard on the street"" also seems to indicate that. Do you have the free subscription through the library? You can sign up for that under W in Databases A-Z. It's the second match under Wall. 
14:18:59 - Barry Zaslow : Meanwhile I will see if I can get some more info for you.
14:19:31 - Patron : Ok will look into that. Thank you
14:19:43 - Patron : I do not have the subscription but will sign up
14:28:21 - Barry Zaslow : The article in your document looks to be from Jan. 30, 2020 Wall Street Journal and looks identical to what you sent me. It appears on page B1. I was able to find this using the WSJ database as searched through ProQuest, using the authors' names and some keywords. Since the 2018 year was the one previous to the year of the losses, it had to be late 2019 or early 2020. Hope this helps.
14:29:05 - Patron : Thank you so so much! I greatly appreciate it.
14:29:52 - Barry Zaslow : Sure. If you are doing any more business-related things that WSJ subscription should come in handy. There is also a free NYTimes one under ""N"" in Databases A-Z
14:30:20 - Patron : Sounds good, will look into it! Thank you again
14:30:57 - Barry Zaslow : Have a good afternoon and don't work too hard during the break (if you are a Miami student or staff member!)

I just want to ask if I still need to include ""for the Collaborative VLS Trial Group"" in the list of authors when I do referencing. 

Please check this: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2816267

Thank you!","","41","","11:20:25 - Kristen Adams : Hi, let me have a look
11:20:37 - Patron : Thank you...
11:21:50 - Kristen Adams : I think I'd leave that off, and just include the people's names
11:23:25 - Patron : Ok. Thank you. Also, I tried Zoterobib for the same article and it gave other author names. I'm not sure why but I can't find them in the article. Can you please enlighten me?
11:23:26 - Patron : Ruetzler, K., Bustamante, S., Schmidt, M. T., Almonacid-Cardenas, F., Duncan, A., Bauer, A., Turan, A., Skubas, N. J., Sessler, D. I., Collaborative VLS Trial Group, Lin, J., Kumar, N., Malackany, N., Maldonado, Y., Apostolakis, J., Alfirevic, A., Kelava, M., Haargrave, J., Richardson, R., … Yalcin Kutlu, E. (2024). Video laryngoscopy vs direct laryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation in the operating room: A cluster randomized clinical trial. JAMA. <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2024.0762"" target=""_blank"">https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2024.0762</a>
11:25:33 - Kristen Adams : It sounds like the other names (and the 'for the collaborative VLS trail group') are inlcuded in the articles' metatdata and so the citation tools will include those
11:27:03 - Patron : Looks like it. Shall I include all these names then? Or just the ones listed on the front page?
11:27:38 - Kristen Adams : I'd probably just use the ones listed on the paper itself
11:28:35 - Patron : Ok then. I'll do that. Thank you. Can I ask about another one please?
11:28:42 - Kristen Adams : yes
11:30:14 - Kristen Adams : go ahead
11:30:24 - Patron : <a href=""https://www.rcoa.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/2023-02/NAP4%20Full%20Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">https://www.rcoa.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/2023-02/NAP4%20Full%20Report.pdf</a>
11:32:12 - Patron : This report has main editors on the front page. But for every chapter, it has different authors. If I want to reference this report, shall I just use the name of the authors of the specific chapter I want to cite?
11:32:40 - Kristen Adams : probably both
11:32:50 - Kristen Adams : I'm not sure which citation style you are using
11:33:03 - Patron : Sorry, APA 7 please
11:33:30 - Kristen Adams : however, it's typical for these to be chapter name and authors, in whole report/book title and editors
11:34:17 - Kristen Adams : let me pull up our page on this
11:34:22 - Kristen Adams : for apa
11:34:54 - Patron : Yes please. Thank you for your help.
11:36:15 - Patron : For example, I need to cite the info from chapter 12. Authors for chapter 12 differ from the editors on the front page.
11:36:16 - Kristen Adams : <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/citation/apa_electronic-examples"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/citation/apa_electronic-examples</a>
11:36:39 - Kristen Adams : I'd follow the advise under 'chapter in an edited book'
11:36:48 - Patron : Yes, I'm on this page.
11:36:51 - Kristen Adams : that has the same format I described
11:38:38 - Patron : But this one is not a book. It's public health annual report.
11:38:47 - Patron : That's why I'm confused.
11:40:36 - Kristen Adams : I understand. You could use the Government Reports style of citation too - since it is more of a report than a book
11:41:29 - Kristen Adams : but because each chapter has it's own authors identified and there are editors for the overall report, it makes sense not the leave those names out and use the format they have for book chapters
11:41:44 - Kristen Adams : it just means you are giving more information
11:44:05 - Kristen Adams : I don't have it with me at the moment, but later today I could look through the APA book - I have a physical copy that has all the possible citations - a lot of which aren't on this guide we have
11:45:23 - Patron : Yes please. If you can give me example for this one please. I have an example from our university, but that one does not include author's name.
11:45:24 - Patron : Reports and Consultation Papers
If there is no individual author, reports and consultation papers will name the organisation as the corporate author. The reference may include a code, e.g.:
British Council of Health Carers. (2011). Foundations of anti-oppressive practice. BCHC (EG2 – 11/BC/22).
11:46:12 - Kristen Adams : Sure. I'll check in the book later today
11:46:15 - Patron : I just want to know how to doe it properly with the names of the authors please...
11:46:20 - Patron : Thank you so much.
11:46:40 - Kristen Adams : Can you share your email so I can follow up later?
11:47:38 - Patron : Yes. emmanuelle.avance@gstt.nhs.uk.
11:47:44 - Patron : Thank you.
11:48:43 - Kristen Adams : Ok, sounds good. I'll check and get back to you later today.
11:49:01 - Patron : Thank you so much for your help.

13:38:25 - Patron : I have looked throughout google scholar and the Miami library- not I am not sure if I have looked at specific data bases
13:38:59 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, those are both good resources! I was thinking ERIC might be a useful tool. Here is our education guide.

13:39:33 - Zachary Grisham : Give me a moment to see what I can find.
13:41:10 - Zachary Grisham : Oh good! It looks like randomized control trials are a subject heading in ERIC
13:41:20 - Zachary Grisham : That means we can differentiate from other articles.
13:41:33 - Zachary Grisham : Using that link, could you go into the ERIC database?
13:43:01 - Zachary Grisham : It also seems that there are many ways to define effectiveness in this database. Were you looking for program effectiveness or instructional effectiveness?
13:43:52 - Patron : I am looking for curriculum effectiveness comparing two curriculums- I have to create a research proposal or an assignment. I will look into the ERIC database
13:45:42 - Patron : Do you know where within the ERIC database I can specifify randomized control trials? Thank you for your help!
13:46:00 - Zachary Grisham : Yep! Type in ""Randomized Controlled Trials""
13:46:20 - Zachary Grisham : If you look at all of the articles, there will be a subject heading within the subjects section of the articles.
13:46:37 - Zachary Grisham : Those with that subject heading should be a Randomized Controlled Trial
13:47:15 - Zachary Grisham : I should specify, type in ""Randomized Controlled Trials"" in the search bar.
13:48:05 - Zachary Grisham : Does that make sense?
13:48:53 - Patron : Yes, Thank you!
13:49:26 - Patron : Do you feel that meeting with a librarian in person could be beneficial for me? I am really struggling with creating this research proposal and was wondering if you knew of any resources on campus?
13:49:57 - Zachary Grisham : Yep, meeting with a librarian would definitely be beneficial as you try to find resources. 
13:50:21 - Zachary Grisham : I would be happy to zoom, or ask our education librarian if she wishes to join in our conversation.
13:50:28 - Zachary Grisham : She is on chat with me at the moment as well.
13:50:52 - Zachary Grisham : Or if you wish to meet with another librarian, you could schedule an appointment here.

13:58:32 - Zachary Grisham : Ok! You are welcome
13:58:47 - Patron : For this assignment I mostly need assistance with the research proposal process vs. research article search as this is more of a hypothetical assignment examining our ability to create a research proposal. Are there any research tutors on campus?
13:59:12 - Zachary Grisham : Ohhhh I misunderstood you. 
13:59:22 - Zachary Grisham : Hmm good question, let me check really quick!

13:19:26 - Patron : yes I think ive found one goos source so far im just struggling to find some more that relate to my thesis that Henry (the main character) grew to be stronger to his cultural identity from the discrimination and racism he faced.
13:20:31 - Barry Zaslow : Did you get this one from MLA bibliography: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=mzh&amp;AN=202017094580&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=mzh&amp;AN=202017094580&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a>
13:21:13 - Patron : No I didnt get that one, I will look into it
13:21:28 - Patron : is there anymore that you think could be helpful
13:22:07 - Barry Zaslow : Our English librarian is on chat with me right now. Let me see if he wants to join our search
13:22:20 - Patron : thank you.
13:24:35 - Patron : these are the requirements for my sources'
13:24:50 - Patron : Two scholarly journal articles (at least ten pages in length) from a peer-reviewed, scholarly journal
One additional source that you find through the Miami Libraries system (newspaper article, magazine article, shorter scholarly journal article, a documentary, a book)
One scholarly web source (check with me for questions)
13:25:00 - Barry Zaslow : Mark says he will be joining so I will invite him now
13:25:07 - Patron : thanks!
13:25:39 - Mark Dahlquist : Hi Maryam, thanks for bringing us this question. Please give me a moment to look this over.<br />
13:25:55 - Patron : of course, thanks so much!
13:28:11 - Mark Dahlquist : Thanks for waiting. It looks like there was only a single result from a MLA search for articles about this title, but I think we may be able to find some other sources.<br />
13:29:04 - Mark Dahlquist : Do you need peer-reviewed sources (peer-reviewed journal ariticles) or would you be willing to look at things like dissertations or MA theses?<br />
13:29:32 - Mark Dahlquist : It can be hard to find a lot of journal articles on relatively recent novels.<br />
13:29:48 - Patron : the sources don't have to completely correlate with the book. For instance, we can use sources that relate to that period or use biographies from people who have gone through something similar.
13:30:22 - Mark Dahlquist : Great; we may also be able to find sources on this author.<br />
13:30:27 - Patron : The requirement is to find peer-reviewed sources
13:31:52 - Mark Dahlquist : Hmm; I see. I will point out that there are a good number of non-peer reviewed sources on this text that you can find by doing a search for the novel's title (in quotes) in the Google Scholar tab of the MU Library homepage.<br />
13:31:55 - Patron : I'm not sure if barry showed you this but this is the requirements my professor gave for this essay,Two scholarly journal articles (at least ten pages in length) from a peer-reviewed, scholarly journal
One additional source that you find through the Miami Libraries system (newspaper article, magazine article, shorter scholarly journal article, a documentary, a book)
One scholarly web source (check with me for questions)
13:33:01 - Mark Dahlquist : Ah great, thanks. We'll find those sources, You might want to ask your professor about PhD and MA theses; these can be useful, but they are not the required sources for this assignment.<br />
13:33:32 - Mark Dahlquist : So, I will go ahead and see if I can find some additional peer-reviewed journal sources.<br />
13:33:39 - Mark Dahlquist : Please hold on a moment.<br />
13:33:42 - Patron : thank you.
13:38:28 - Mark Dahlquist : Thanks for your patience, I was having an internet issue.<br />
13:38:42 - Patron : you're all good
13:46:33 - Mark Dahlquist : I'm still looking; it may take me a few more minutes. I can email you in 20-30 minutes if you'd like.<br />
13:46:52 - Patron : would you like my email?
13:47:11 - Mark Dahlquist : Sure, I'll send you some information via email. I may find a few sources I think.<br />
13:47:41 - Patron : okay sounds good my email is
13:47:50 - Patron : maryamalshawk12@gmail.com
13:48:10 - Mark Dahlquist : Great, thanks! I'll be in touch shortly.<br />

10:20:42 - Jenny Presnell : ok
10:22:01 - Jenny Presnell : This article comes from 
10:22:04 - Jenny Presnell : <a name=""citation"">APA handbook of contemporary family psychology</a>
10:22:15 - Jenny Presnell : which we don't have
10:22:49 - Patron : How do I get it?
10:22:52 - Jenny Presnell : if you found this the APA Psych Net or in onesearch
10:23:08 - Jenny Presnell : you would click on the find it button
10:23:14 - Patron : APA Psych Net.  One search could not find it.
10:23:19 - Jenny Presnell : I wouldn't use onesearch for this
10:23:31 - Jenny Presnell : Personally Onesearch is my last resort
10:23:31 - Patron : What should I use instead?
10:23:32 - Jenny Presnell : but

10:26:02 - Patron : How do I access that link from the search page (King Library)?
10:26:18 - Jenny Presnell : If you knew you wanted to be in the psyc journal literature I would go directly to the index itself
10:26:21 - Jenny Presnell : so AP
10:27:13 - Patron : ok
10:27:28 - Jenny Presnell : APA Sci net is listed under databases A-Z or on the Psychology Research Guide (under research guies on the main page)

10:28:28 - Patron : It's hit or miss at times
10:28:36 - Jenny Presnell : then I'd use the tabs at the top of the big box
10:28:46 - Jenny Presnell : and click on books and more or journals and more
10:29:06 - Jenny Presnell : I still can't find some things in One Search and I do this every day

18:12:53 - Katie Gibson : One of the historical newspaper databases like New York Times Historical or Chicago Tribune historical linked on that page would probably also be helpful
18:13:03 - Patron : what do you think are good search terms to find a good article are?
18:13:12 - Katie Gibson : Hm, that's a good question
18:14:07 - Katie Gibson : It might be best in the American Periodicals to start super general with something like women, but then limit to the date range you want
18:14:36 - Katie Gibson : and maybe focus in on the type of thing like advertisements... those can say a lot about how women were being marketed to and what their roles were supposed to be
18:14:50 - Patron : okay thank you for your advice
18:15:23 - Katie Gibson : you're welcome... let me know if you don't find anything that you can use, and we'll try other approaches
18:15:30 - Patron : okay will do

Here's a link to one result I found (please open this link in a new window): <a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/1384164/us-teen-girls-of-color-exposure-to-racism-social-media-and-real-life/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.statista.com/statistics/1384164/us-teen-girls-of-color-exposure-to-racism-social-media-and-real-life/</a><br />
20:31:20 - Patron : thank you
20:32:32 - Mark Dahlquist : Thanks, I have found a few other useful statistics, though not quite as many as I had hoped. <br />
20:32:48 - Patron : okay
20:33:29 - Mark Dahlquist : Do you think you have enough to go on now, or would you like to continue doing some more searching?<br />
20:34:31 - Mark Dahlquist : Reading your topic summary that you sent, it looks like you are covering a lot of ground in this presentation.<br />
20:35:04 - Mark Dahlquist : You might want to consider focusing in on one or two core ideas from this presentation (depending on your assignement).<br />
20:35:21 - Patron : Yes kind of, I need more help with
Cultural Pride: Celebrate diverse cultural backgrounds and encourage embracing one's heritage as a source of strength.

Reference: Use examples of cultural traditions or achievements to highlight the richness of diversity.
20:35:43 - Patron : do you have examples of multimodal projects?
20:36:41 - Patron : Im not trying to type everything on my slides, I just want to incorporate points (different articles) and then when I go in depth for that specific section I go off a more detailed article with better points
20:38:11 - Mark Dahlquist : I see. There are quite a few examples of multimodal projects; these can be slide shows or podcasts or videos; sometimes news articles with video and data visualizations can be considered multimodal.<br />
20:38:45 - Patron : I am doing slides with pictures and then want to add my stats and then have myself in the corner for the video part i guess
20:39:12 - Mark Dahlquist : It might be helpful to begin with 1 or 2 examples of cultural achievements that highlight the richness of diversity and build your project around that example.<br />
20:39:13 - Patron : but this is just the draft but i want it to be as detailed and clean as possible so i wont have to do to much for my final
20:39:21 - Patron : okay thanks
20:40:32 - Mark Dahlquist : Do you have an example of a project that represents embracing one's heritage as a source of strength?<br />

20:42:07 - Mark Dahlquist : Thanks!
20:46:38 - Mark Dahlquist : Hmm; there is a lot to take regarding this assignment, which seems to include a slide show and also a video.<br />
20:46:47 - Patron : yes
20:47:19 - Mark Dahlquist : One question I have is whether the slide show and video are intended for young women of color or are intended more for educators or your professor, etc.<br />
20:47:35 - Patron : for both
20:47:44 - Mark Dahlquist : I see. <br />
20:47:48 - Mark Dahlquist : Cool!<br /><br />
20:47:56 - Patron : im trying to hit to the reqruiments for the assignment and also reach the audience im targeting

18:19:27 - Katie Gibson : there's a couple I want to try to see what is best for you... one moment
18:19:47 - Patron : Okay thanks!
18:20:49 - Katie Gibson : ATLA Religion index has some articles, but I don't know if they are specifically about the 1990s
18:20:55 - Katie Gibson : Do you know how to get to that?
18:21:54 - Katie Gibson : Also... the Iranian revolution is the 1970s, so that might be part of it
18:22:02 - Patron : Not exactly. I know it is a very narrow subject.
18:22:17 - Patron : I mean the beginning of the Islamic Republic
18:22:30 - Katie Gibson : it's the war with Iraq that Persepolis talks about and I think that was later
18:22:33 - Patron : Sorry but.. I actually might think both could work!
18:22:41 - Katie Gibson : Ah, ok, in that case
18:23:05 - Katie Gibson : Ok so here's what I found in ATLA religion index: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a6h&amp;db=reh&amp;bquery=islamaphobia+AND+france&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a6h&amp;db=reh&amp;bquery=islamaphobia+AND+france&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a>

18:29:26 - Patron : difficult to find an article. I tried to see if persepolis was in any of them but it said 0 results
18:29:51 - Katie Gibson : Do you need articles about the historical situation, or Persepolis itself
18:31:02 - Katie Gibson : Because if you need articles about the book, you'll want a database called MLA international bibliography: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=mzh&amp;bquery=persepolis&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=mzh&amp;bquery=persepolis&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site</a>

19:30:13 - Barry Zaslow : That's OK. There's over 80 people on staff in all the libraries!
19:36:26 - Barry Zaslow : So here's the situation. We do have access to that journal (<i>International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction</i>) in several databases but with a delay of one year. Since the article was just published in February 2024, the best route would be to try Interlibrary Loan as some other schools might not have the delay. If you haven't used this service it's free to students/staff so go to this link:https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html. You create an account with your unique ID/password, put in new request, article, and then fill in the boxes with the citation. Staff will try to find it and send you a link to a scanned version if some other university or organization does have it. Is this clear? I don't know if Elizabeth has used this but she likely knows how it works. If you get confused Sheila Sparks is the person to contact although she works 7am-3pm most days. sparkssk@miamioh.edu

Librarians can work with you to find and cite sources.

The best resource for reading over and reviewing your essay with you would be the Howe Writing Center!

13:44:12 - Zachary Grisham : Oh, thanks for letting us know! I will reach out to the guide owner and warn them. It is likely that the number just has not been updated yet. If you scroll a little bit farther down though there is a contact number at the bottom of the page.

14:37:06 - Patron : Hello Katie,
14:37:14 - Katie Gibson : Since we last chatted, I thought of another resource that might be helpful
14:37:22 - Patron : Good
14:37:43 - Katie Gibson : IEEE explore may be a good one: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/ieee-xplore"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/ieee-xplore</a>
14:38:06 - Patron : Nice
14:38:20 - Katie Gibson : My guess is that since we're still very early in the AI development, there might not be much scholarship about your topic specifically but you'll find plenty of scholarship on AI and teaching methodology
14:38:29 - Katie Gibson : and others about AI and student engagement
14:38:40 - Katie Gibson : and others about AI in african higher education
14:38:48 - Katie Gibson : but not much that covers the overlap of the three.
14:38:50 - Patron : Yes
14:40:01 - Katie Gibson : But if IEEE Explore doesn't have much... try Google Scholar: <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C36&amp;q=AI+technologies+impact+teaching+methodologies%2C+student+engagement%2C+and+learning+outcomes+within+African+higher+education+institutions&amp;btnG="" target=""_blank"">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C36&amp;q=AI+technologies+impact+teaching+methodologies%2C+student+engagement%2C+and+learning+outcomes+within+African+higher+education+institutions&amp;btnG=</a>
14:40:16 - Katie Gibson : that picks up articles published Open Access that might not be in our research databases
14:40:57 - Katie Gibson : But I'm also a Humanities Librarian... you might want to reach out to your subject librarian to get more in-depth help.
14:41:24 - Patron : Any suggested librarians
14:41:31 - Katie Gibson : Roger Justus is the computer science librarian: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/compeng"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/compeng</a>
14:41:50 - Katie Gibson : and then Krista McDonald or Mark Shores at Hamilton might also be good people to talk to 
14:42:02 - Katie Gibson : Krista's email is: mcdonak@miamioh.edu
14:42:13 - Katie Gibson : and Mark's email is: mark.shores@miamioh.edu

16:16:48 - Mark Dahlquist : The library homepage is a great place to start with a search like this. You can use the ""articles and more"" tab to find peer-reviewed journal articles, for example.<br />
16:17:16 - Mark Dahlquist : I will find some initial articles using this tool to help get you started. Hold on one moment, please.<br />

10:59:56 - Patron : yes!  it's hard to find!
11:00:30 - Patron : Joseph Rode stated this was available in the library
11:00:48 - Roger Justus : Ok I am sure it is then, just not in an easy to find place!  
11:02:15 - Patron : I appreciate your help!
11:02:45 - Roger Justus : No worries, none of the Business Librarians are around or we would have had this already! :)
11:03:07 - Patron : lol....and it seems so simple!
11:03:35 - Roger Justus : I know!  Weird question, did he give you a ""case number"" for this?  Sometimes that is one way we can look as well.
11:04:09 - Roger Justus : Oh and what class number (Bus101 like) is this?  I can see if it is in the guide for that class too.
11:04:51 - Patron : here are his notes from the syllabus - In addition to the Harvard case studies, the course includes five readings from Harvard Business Review.  All of the articles are available for free through the Miami University library webpage by doing a search for ""Harvard Business Review"" under ""E-Journals"".
11:05:05 - Patron : and MGT654
11:05:21 - Patron : finding these articles takes a masters degree! lol
11:05:51 - Roger Justus : Great ok  - fyi I looked at the Harvard Bus review and month it says it was published but is not in our list!  But we will get there!
11:06:27 - Patron : oh geez
11:06:52 - Roger Justus : that happens - as I said it may take a moment but we will get there.
11:06:55 - Patron : I don't feel so bad not being able to find it now lol
11:07:28 - Roger Justus : No dont, the business stuff sometime is a bit weird in how it lists, which is why we have TWO specialist business librarians.
11:11:16 - Roger Justus : hey is this it???  Per the HBR site it says

She is at abbittrj@miamioh.edu. Also our Geography Librarian, Kristen Adams may have some ideas for you at adamsk3@miamioh.edu as I believe she has been doing some work in this area. One of them should be able to answer the market driven question as that is beyond our available information. Hope this helps.
13:57:47 - Patron : Thank you very much Barry. I will do as you have advised
13:58:27 - Barry Zaslow : You are welcome. I know both of them quite well and they are very nice and should provide good guidance for you.
13:59:20 - Patron : I agree with you absolutely. Abbitt Robbyn was my instructor when I was doing my graduate studies in the department.
14:04:36 - Barry Zaslow : Glad to hear you had positive experience there. GIS has really taken off at Miami in the past decade although I'm still not very familiar with it being in the arts &amp; humanities mostly.

09:22:08 - Kristen Adams : let me look for this
09:22:49 - Kristen Adams : Ok, I see what you mean
09:23:01 - Kristen Adams : it still tells you the page number though - 
09:23:21 - Kristen Adams : where it says 'source'
09:23:23 - Kristen Adams : Source:<a>Preventing School Failure</a>. Sum 1993 37(4):6-10.
09:23:28 - Kristen Adams : the 6-10 are the pages
09:23:53 - Patron : Yes, I know it is pages 6-10. However, in order to do in-text citations I need to know what page number a certain quote from the text is from.
09:24:27 - Kristen Adams : Oh I see. I get it now.
09:25:31 - Kristen Adams : that's a great question. I don't often use citation formats that require the page for in-text citations. 
09:25:42 - Kristen Adams : Let me see if I can find this another way that has the PDF version
09:27:37 - Patron : My professor is having us use APA format and I brought this up to her but I do not think she understood what my dilemma was. Thank you for helping out! I have found the article through Google but I would have to purchase the journal and I do not want to do that.
09:28:30 - Kristen Adams : I also found it via Taylor and Francis, but would also have to pay for it there
09:29:03 - Patron : Yes, that is where I found it as well.
09:30:19 - Kristen Adams : It's so old, 1993, that it might be easier to find a print version, is what I'm thinking
09:30:59 - Kristen Adams : Is this the only article you are having this issue with?
09:32:53 - Patron : I am a graduate student who is not near campus unfortunately. So, I do not have access to the Library. I have other articles that are only HTML Full Text but I have not directly quoted them, only paraphrased. I believe (if I am correct) I do not need to have page numbers when I paraphrase in APA format. Only Author and year of publication.
09:34:13 - Kristen Adams : I see. Ok. Let me check the APA guide. I have a print copy.
09:34:32 - Kristen Adams : I'm still not finding any PDF of it, and not a print copy either
09:34:41 - Kristen Adams : Let me have a look.
09:35:07 - Kristen Adams : But we might talk to the professor again if we just can't get specific page numbers. 
09:38:01 - Kristen Adams : yeah, it does say to include the page number for a direct quote
09:38:36 - Kristen Adams : I'd suggest checking with your professor again to see what they want you to do.
09:39:05 - Patron : I may just change my writing from direct quotes to paraphrasing since my professor did not understand what my issue was with page numbers. She seemed to think I just didn't want to include the page numbers instead of not having access to them.
09:39:17 - Patron : Thank you for your help!
09:39:58 - Kristen Adams : Ok, that's a tactic too. Or you could guesstimate the page number. There's not that many pages. 
09:40:46 - Kristen Adams : Glad to help
09:41:44 - Kristen Adams : It's too bad that in the html version they don't include a little note such as end of page x, when the page changes - that would have been helpful
09:43:19 - Patron : I was wondering that as well. If I give a good guess it might be ok. If I don't have access to the page numbers neither would my professor.
09:44:00 - Kristen Adams : True
09:44:16 - Kristen Adams : that's what I was thinking
09:46:27 - Patron : Well, thank you for your help! I appreciate it!
09:46:37 - Kristen Adams : Your welcome

14:35:51 - Kristen Adams : I looked up the journal and found it here - <a href=""https://publications.ebsco.com/details/42048?custId=s9002934&amp;groupId=main&amp;profileId=pfui&amp;orderBy=relevance&amp;search=Journal+of+Personality+and+Social+Psychology&amp;resourceTypeOptionSelected=1%2C2%2C3%2C4%2C5%2C6%2C7%2C8%2C9%2C10%2C11%2C12%2C13%2C14"" target=""_blank"">https://publications.ebsco.com/details/42048?custId=s9002934&amp;groupId=main&amp;profileId=pfui&amp;orderBy=relevance&amp;search=Journal+of+Personality+and+Social+Psychology&amp;resourceTypeOptionSelected=1%2C2%2C3%2C4%2C5%2C6%2C7%2C8%2C9%2C10%2C11%2C12%2C13%2C14</a>
14:35:58 - Kristen Adams : you can access it via OhioLInk
14:36:03 - Kristen Adams : does that work for you?
14:39:28 - Patron : This works great! Is there a way to get my institutional access working properly, so I can access other APA journal from their website/from the library website? When I click the 'login with your credentials' on the Miami website, it gives me the error message from above.
14:39:45 - Kristen Adams : Glad that worked
14:40:00 - Kristen Adams : Let me check APA itself and see if it's giving me the same
14:41:23 - Kristen Adams : I tried PsychNet, from APA and it looks like you need to set up an account with them
14:41:26 - Patron : Got it, thanks. It doesn't seem to be just APA, but Ebsco? E.g., when I try to login just on searching through the libraries, it's giving me trouble.
If this isn't something you know about though, I can always try to restart my computer and see if it's just a buggy thing. Access via OhioLink for the journal was the most important right now :)
14:42:26 - Kristen Adams : Ok. EBSCO, on campus is working for me right now. You can try clearing cookie/cache ect, and resetting to see it that helps.
14:42:44 - Kristen Adams : If not, please let us know and we can troubleshoot further
14:43:54 - Patron : Okay, great! I'll give the reset a go and see if it helps, and recontact if it doesn't. Thanks so much!

12:13:22 - Patron : Thanks!  I woule like to use curbside pickup.  The other book is ""A Sea of Change""by Mark Ott: PS3515 .E37 Z7515 2008.
12:16:29 - Barry Zaslow : OK. I will go retrieve them right now (assuming they are *really* there) and set them for curbside pickup.

12:17:13 - Patron : Thank You!!!!!
12:17:13 - Barry Zaslow : BTW, if you are looking for a book and know the author and title it's best to choose Books &amp; More on the home page so you don't get all the reviews and such which come in other searches such as One Search

12:29:50 - Barry Zaslow : Don--If you are still here the books are ready at King Circ. You don't have to wait for an e-mail--if you call 513-529-2433 or 513-529-4141 the staff should be able to pull the books from the hold shelf and have someone come to the loading dock/cafe area to meet you.

14:22:53 - Patron : Sure
14:23:33 - Patron : I’m a project dragonfly student observing bears and visitors at a zoo
14:24:28 - Patron : the zoo signage at the exhibit is one of the only signs that says 5e names of the animals and tells their stories (they were orphaned in the wild and its about conservation stories to prevent negative relationships with bears and people in the USA)
14:24:44 - Patron : I am tallying the amount of times someone says the name on the sign or engages with the sign
14:25:06 - Patron : and I found some research about how names evoke empathy in people
14:25:15 - Patron : but I don’t know if there are connections with animals and people
14:25:58 - Ginny Boehme : hmm, this is going to be tough. let me look around and see what I can find, if anything
14:26:24 - Patron : Ok thanks even if you can suggest keywords to search
14:28:10 - Ginny Boehme : can you share the research you found about evoking empathy in people?
14:30:26 - Patron : I don’t have that one in my notes a friend sent it but I can share others
14:31:02 - Patron : empathy for animals: a review of existing literature Yiung, A and Khalil, K A
14:31:12 - Ginny Boehme : ok thank you
14:31:52 - Patron : Another from K A Khalil Beyond inspiration: translating zoo and aquarium experiences into conservation behavior
14:34:07 - Patron : Ps I’m on an iPad at the zoo now if my WiFi is spotty sorry
14:34:39 - Ginny Boehme : This is really challenging, because there are lots of studies of human empathy, but not much about animal empathy. But they use very similar or identical keywords so weeding out irrelevant material is nearly impossible
14:35:26 - Patron : Ohhh ok
14:35:56 - Patron : yeah I am ultimately interested in ways to help people connect to conservation stories through positive emotion
14:36:11 - Patron : are there other ways to approach that.
14:36:33 - Patron : It’s my first semester so I’m still figuring out keywords and searching
14:36:56 - Ginny Boehme : I'm trying to figure out if there are any good keywords for this
14:37:29 - Patron : thank you so much
14:40:10 - Ginny Boehme : Ok, so the best keyword combination I've found so far is (""animal empathy"" OR ""empathy of animal"")
14:40:21 - Ginny Boehme : the quotations are important, those are phrase searches
14:40:34 - Patron : Oh, thank you !
14:40:41 - Patron : Didnt realize about quotes
14:41:18 - Ginny Boehme : there is a lot out there that classifies ""animal empathy"" as empathy towards animals though, so you will still encounter some irrelevant material, but this is the best I can do right now unfortunately

12:00:19 - Barry Zaslow : One database that looks possible is called Political Science Complete in our Databases A-Z list. You can put search terms in the boxes such as ""presidential"" ""election"" ""spending"" or ""expenditures"". It would also help to limit by the most recent 10 years or so using the little date slider on the left. You can choose the type of material and language (English probably) so you don't get a lot of stuff you don't want. Another avenue is to use ""Articles and More"" from the library home page and put in similar keywords. Do these sound useful?

11:14:08 - Patron : I opened the library webpage, typed the title of the book, and several options showed up. But after that, there is no obvious button that says ""check out"" or ""place on hold"" or anything! And now that you mention ebooks, I've tried that before, too, and it says I got them...but then I can never find the book. But that is a problem for another day!
11:14:47 - Roger Justus : Ok cool, can you give me the name of the book and I can look 
11:15:13 - Patron : The book of elsewhere; by John Keogh
11:15:37 - Roger Justus : This system is are going to be updating as well in the next year which should make it simpler.  Thanks I am looking now!
11:20:06 - Roger Justus : Ok, for that book, we actually don't have the book. Those entries are for Book Reviews! 
11:20:50 - Roger Justus : Could the author(s) be Keanu Reeves and China Mieville?
11:21:44 - Patron : Oh! Well, yyes, those are the authors...sorry for the confusion...

Nope, if you are a current Miami student just using those credentials should work.
12:29:24 - Zachary Grisham : Could you try it in a different browser?
12:29:36 - Patron : Okay Let me try
12:30:43 - Patron : I tried just now. It says the information you submitted was invalid

12:31:53 - Zachary Grisham : It is not student id number, it is the email address 
12:32:26 - Patron : Okay. I tried with the email. It didnt work
12:33:13 - Patron : So i was wondering if I should try student ID
12:33:25 - Zachary Grisham : Let me go try and see if a student on the first floor can access the library resources. If they can then we can rule out any difficulty with student accounts. I am betting it might be a registration issue. 
12:33:39 - Zachary Grisham : Where for some reason your account is not acknowledging you as registered.
12:34:30 - Patron : Sounds good to me! im just an incoming freshman. I was just poking around to see what my resources are!
12:37:58 - Zachary Grisham : Oh, welcome to Miami! We have tons of useful resources on a variety of topics. Do you mind if I ask what the focus of your studies will be while you're here? (There are tons of guides on a multitude of topics.) That is the issue then, until you are registered for classes and everything is sorted out you won't have access to the libraries resources. 
12:38:59 - Zachary Grisham : Apologies if I was unclear, the issue with you being unable to access resources is that you are an incoming freshman.
12:38:59 - Patron : Ahh.. ok! Im majoring in Biomedical eng with pre med
12:39:21 - Patron : Im registered for all my classes
12:40:03 - Patron : Was just looking to see what books I might need and If I can find them from the Library
12:41:42 - Zachary Grisham : Awesome, when you do finally get access definitely check out these guides! We have one for resources in <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/biology"" target=""_blank"">biology</a>  and another for those studying <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/cpb_engineering"" target=""_blank"">biomedical engineering</a>  
12:41:52 - Zachary Grisham : In respect to books, I might be able to help with that.
12:41:57 - Zachary Grisham : Even though you do not have access yet.
12:42:10 - Zachary Grisham : You can actually search for those through the onesearch tool or catalog.
12:42:28 - Patron : Thanks Mr. Grisham! Appreciate your help!
12:42:59 - Zachary Grisham : You are welcome! Were there any specific books you wanted me to check? Or did you wish to continue looking by yourself? Happy to help if I can.
12:44:09 - Patron : Let me just play around and see.. If I need anything in specific that Im unable to find.. I will definitely come to you! As of now I dont know what I might need

10:54:13 - Barry Zaslow : There is a section about the Commons and some links to other resources. Carla Myers is the librarian normally involved with these endeavors. You could reach out to her at myersc2@miamioh.edu although she is in and out this summer. Hope this helps.

10:01:11 - Patron : Tsupros, N., Kohler, R., and Hallinen, J. (2009). STEM education: A project to identify the missing

10:01:23 - Patron : This is the reference in another article.
10:02:34 - Megan Jaskowiak : Is this it?

10:03:48 - Patron : I'll need to do a word search.  The article that used this reference had a direct quote.  Just a minute.
10:04:42 - Patron : No, that is not the article.
10:04:56 - Megan Jaskowiak : What is the quote?
10:06:02 - Patron : According to Tsupros (2008), “STEM education is an interdisciplinary approach to
learning where rigorous academic concepts are coupled with real-world lessons as students apply
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in contexts that make connections between school,
community, work, and the global enterprise enabling the development of STEM literacy and with it the
ability to compete in the new economy (Tsupros, 2009).”
10:07:03 - Patron : There is only one TSUPROS in the reference list.  I suspect the article was not well reviewed for references and citations since there was no page number for the quote.
10:07:25 - Patron : Ejiwale, J. (2013). Barriers to successful implementation of STEM education.
Journal of Education and Learning. Vol.7 (2) pp. 63-74.
10:07:39 - Patron : That is article where I found the quote.
10:08:23 - Patron : By the way, I am retired Scripps research staff (6/30/3024) but am still working on a manuscript for one of my grants.
10:08:36 - Megan Jaskowiak : The one I sent is from Carnegie Mellon's archive. Maybe the quote is wrong.
10:10:29 - Patron : Could be the quote is wrong.  As I mentioned, the citations were not well done in this article, so the quote may not be accurate either!  I'll spend some time looking at the article you sent and see what I can find.  Thanks for your help.  Phyllis

12:44:32 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I just looked and I also only see a print copy available. I believe we can still do delivery if that is an option for you. You can also reach out to Katie Gibson who purchases books in this area and she may be able to purchase an electronic copy. Her email is gibsonke@miamioh.edu
12:45:17 - Patron : I am out of state, so I do not believe delivery is an option
12:46:11 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Here is more information on delivery. They can deliver anywhere in the US: <a href=""https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/use/borrow/home-delivery/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/use/borrow/home-delivery/</a>

12:47:28 - Patron : so it is not available even through OhioLink?
12:47:28 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Oh okay got it! I'm happy to send Katie an email with you cc'd to see if she might be able to purchase this as an e-book
12:47:54 - Patron : Great! I appreciate that!
12:47:54 - Jaclyn Spraetz : OhioLINK offers print books that you can request, but unfortunately it doesn't have the same options for e-books
12:48:00 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Okay, I will do that! 
12:48:12 - Patron : Thank you very much

11:30:58 - Abigail Morgan : Are you a new student?
11:31:10 - Patron : yes, transfer
11:33:58 - Abigail Morgan : OK, that is probably why you are having trouble. We will have our next upload of new patrons on Aug. 26. However, you can come to the circulation desk in person at King Library or reach out to Rob Withers or Kris Abney who can manually create your record earlier. You will need to tell them you are a new student and provide either of the following so they can make the record: 

Patron records are easiest to create if:<ul><li>People have their Banner+ number (we have instructions on how people can look them up in Workday).</li><li>People are physically present with their ID or their phone ID, so we can scan in the barcode (we can work around it if necessary)</li></ul>
11:35:06 - Patron : I won't be on campus until 8/24, was just trying to get a head start on books.
11:35:06 - Abigail Morgan : Here are the email address for Rob and Kris: witherre@miamioh.edu and abneykl@miamioh.edu
11:36:06 - Abigail Morgan : They should be able to create your record if you reach out to them. Just make sure you let them know you are new so they can have context for your request
11:36:21 - Patron : sounds good, thank you!

My name is Donald Simmons Jr., and I'm a New Jersey resident.
My ancestors, Warner Washington IV (1807-1874) and Sarah Taylor (1822-1909) resided in Butler County, Ohio and Fayette County, Indiana.
Warner's father is also Warner Washington II, from Virginia (1751-1829) and Sarah's parents are Moses Taylor, from North Carolina (1795-1838) and Mary Haywood, a German immigrant (1795 - after 24 January 1839).
Moses and Mary lived in Oxford Township, Butler County, Ohio as well as Sarah and her siblings.

I checked the county records and couldn't find one for them there.

14:24:18 - Laura Birkenhauer : OK, so I checked OhioLINK and their journal volumes are Library Use Only. So they cannot be sent to Oxford. I can request it through ""Get It Now"" for you, and you'll receive it in 8 hours (often much quicker).

15:30:04 - Kristen Adams : What does the footnote say?
15:30:09 - Patron : The book is Lectures on Ancient History ... by B. G. Niebuhr
15:30:25 - Patron : page 347: ""Comp. Hist. Of Rome, i. p. 520, foll.""
15:30:35 - Patron : And that's not exactly a unique title for a book

15:30:58 - Patron : yes
15:31:09 - Kristen Adams : and we are looking for Comp, History of Rome?
15:31:11 - Patron : yes
15:31:26 - Kristen Adams : Is there a bibliography in the back of the book with full citations?
15:31:29 - Kristen Adams : I wonder...
15:31:32 - Kristen Adams : that might help us

15:31:52 - Kristen Adams : not at the end of the chapter either?

15:32:12 - Patron : actually wait, this book has three volumes, vol 3 is up on the shelves still, should I go check that?
15:32:22 - Patron : Also no there is nothing at the end of the chapter either
15:32:42 - Kristen Adams : it might be in volume 3, 
15:32:50 - Kristen Adams : would be worth checking, I think
15:33:00 - Patron : Ok, I will be right back
15:33:04 - Kristen Adams : ok
15:38:07 - Kristen Adams : So I tried looking for a book of this title, either complete or contemporary history of Rome, in a source called WorldCat, which is a catalog of libraries across the world
15:38:17 - Kristen Adams : I didn't see any that would match this
15:38:42 - Kristen Adams : From 

 ""Comp. Hist. Of Rome, i. p. 520, foll."", I'd presume it's a book of 520 pages
15:38:42 - Patron : hmmm okay, I just found the other volumes
15:38:55 - Kristen Adams : foll would likely mean folio or book
15:39:31 - Kristen Adams : are you in King right now?

Have you done any searching on the library website yet? There are ways to limit to material types such as videos.
18:58:30 - Patron : How can you limit the search?
19:01:33 - Barry Zaslow : For example I did a keyword search for Fair Housing Act and then on the left there is an option to limit by material type so I chose videos and it brought up 7. You could do that for each topic. Of course this one of the three is the most specific so you might get *a lot* under civil rights movements and Vietnam War. Not all the videos that match will be owned by the library, though if you use One Search (the basic search box). You might try starting with Books &amp; More and use these words as subject searches to get more likely library-owned materials. Does this help?
19:03:17 - Barry Zaslow : There is a list of boxes to check and you might have to go to ""more options"" to see the video one as they seem to be listed by how many are in each category, e.g. books, journals, videos, etc.
19:04:15 - Barry Zaslow : Kanopy.com in Databases A-Z is also a good resource for videos and they will tell you right away if we have access to a particular title if it sounds promising
19:05:52 - Barry Zaslow : The Kanopy ones are usually available to stream online, while some of the other matches will likely be on DVD or even VHS at the Instructional Materials Center on ground floor King or at Hamilton or Middletown if they purchased them for their campuses.

13:30:45 - Barry Zaslow : You can also send an e-mail to systems@miamioh.edu if you get stuck; they are experts although their hours are usually just during 8-5 weekdays
13:30:59 - Patron : I asked the circulation desk yesterday and they said I couldn't get it on once of those laptops
13:31:06 - Patron : desktops
13:33:22 - Barry Zaslow : Oh, sorry to hear that. I will mention this to people with more authority than I to update the information. Meanwhile, go ahead and send systems@miamioh.edu an e-mail if you have not already done so and explain your situation about SPSS.
13:33:41 - Patron : Thank you I will do that
13:34:00 - Barry Zaslow : Hope that works out. These tech things are ever-changing.

16:07:02 - Abigail Morgan : If you are looking to find broadest number, I think checking either Google Scholar or Articles and More would be best

16:20:08 - Abigail Morgan : You can always add the search term qualitative or quantitative to your search, but I am not sure that would surface all the relevant studies. Unfortunately this isn't the kind of information that people decided to capture when indexes were first created, so it is hard to find now.

19:25:41 - Kristen Adams : so to narrow it down, if you have other key words to add in, that would help
19:26:06 - Kristen Adams : you can also use those 'refine results' at the left hand side to limit to just journal articles or ebooks

12:21:37 - Patron : Thank you. Is this something I can assign to my classes?
12:22:57 - Laura Birkenhauer : I'm still looking at locating it through our databases, sorry for the delay. But, yes, it wouldn't certainly work to assign it to your class if we have access.
12:23:14 - Patron : thanks
12:25:57 - Laura Birkenhauer : Thanks for holding. I'm chatting with our Business Librarian about this now. I'm finding it online but not through our databases, so I'm still working on this. 
12:26:11 - Laura Birkenhauer : If you'd prefer, we can reach out via email instead? Or you're also welcome to wait here.

12:32:55 - Patron : No problem - thanks for your help
12:33:52 - Zachary Grisham : Hey Thomas, this is interesting, I am going to try and see what issue this is in then find it in the actual journal.

12:36:01 - Zachary Grisham : As you can see in the 2024 section (top right once you have entered Business Source Complete) That we are supposed to have this month's publication.
12:38:26 - Zachary Grisham : After some more searching, I do not believe we have this. However, I will look into why and figure out if we can get access to it. 
12:39:43 - Patron : That is odd. maybe it is just available via HRB.org.  It is a series of articles called The Big Idea Series / Overcoming Overwork
12:41:37 - Zachary Grisham : That is what I was thinking, maybe this is a separate thing from the actual HBR publication? Maybe a sub-series? I really do not know yet, but it is curious. Thanks for the question, it will be fun to figure out. :) 
12:41:48 - Zachary Grisham : Would you like me to email you when I have a better understanding of it?
12:42:42 - Patron : Yes - I found the articles online at HBR.org.  Do we have a subscription to access this content?
12:43:29 - Zachary Grisham : Nope, the library does not. You can ask the folks who handle subscriptions at Farmer, but I doubt they have access either.  
12:43:50 - Patron : OK.  I'll ask around.  Thanks!

20:14:32 - Patron : Here is the error message I just received CloudFront attempted to establish a connection with the origin, but either the attempt failed or the origin closed the connection. We can't connect to the server for this app or website at this time. There might be too much traffic or a configuration error. Try again later, or contact the app or website owner.
If you provide content to customers through CloudFront, you can find steps to troubleshoot and help prevent this error by reviewing the CloudFront documentation.
Not sure if this helps!

14:06:11 - Patron : thank you, do you know any books on the imperial cult?
14:06:36 - Zachary Grisham : Would depend on which imperial cult you are referring to.
14:07:14 - Zachary Grisham : Could you tell me more about it?
14:08:04 - Patron : I didnt know there were multiple, did the different emperors have different cults? I dont know much of the subject as of now, but its a topic i would like to write about
14:09:21 - Zachary Grisham : Ahh, so you are saying a cult that worships the emperor as a god? All emperors or a specific one?
14:09:30 - Patron : I honestly dont know
14:09:33 - Zachary Grisham : Would be an interesting topic to research!
14:09:41 - Zachary Grisham : No worries, let us take a glance into the collections.

14:12:05 - Zachary Grisham : It is about how religion changed in Rome from the single city state to the massive empire it became.
14:13:32 - Patron : is there a book over rome adopting the deities/practices of cultures they conquered?
14:13:54 - Patron : my bad
14:13:59 - Patron : I just say the link you sent
14:14:03 - Patron : It was that lol
14:14:27 - Zachary Grisham : No problem! I know a bit about Roman history as well and many of the books we have been chatting about would have this actually. 
14:14:50 - Zachary Grisham : I suggest looking into their ancient religion before they absorbed Greek religion btw.
14:15:02 - Zachary Grisham : It is full of werewolves and other interesting things!
14:15:21 - Zachary Grisham : Much less fleshed out then their version of the greek one though.
14:15:58 - Zachary Grisham : Do you believe you have enough information to start your research yet?
14:20:13 - Patron : Is there a book or article about how roman festivals and rituals became more ""grand"" as emperors tried using them to seem (for lack of a better word) ""better""
14:20:44 - Patron : or how the first imperial cult formed maybe?
14:22:19 - Zachary Grisham : So, both of those could be chapters of the books that we have been chatting about. However, you may also wish to focus on books about Roman festivals (Saturnalia, etc..) They will likely have the history of how they changed. 
14:22:57 - Zachary Grisham : In respect to the formation of the first imperial cult, we would need to pinpoint which cult we were interested in to figure out when it started. 
14:23:00 - Zachary Grisham : Let me see.
14:25:55 - Zachary Grisham : Yep, this one looks like something you might be interested in

17:43:35 - Mark Dahlquist : Hi, thanks for this question. Unfortunately, there is not an easy way around this. You might mention this problem to your instructor (who might not be aware of this limitation). Your instructor might be able to put a chapter or two on digital reserve, but unfortunately this could take a week or so to process.<br />
17:43:52 - Patron : I am the instructor
17:44:32 - Mark Dahlquist : Whoops, sorry! Let me find the link for a digital course reserve request....<br />

17:45:55 - Mark Dahlquist : This might be the a way to put a limited amount of content on reserve for a larger number of students.<br />
17:45:56 - Patron : Thanks for the help! Would each have to request individually? The homework is already assigned and due before the next class.
17:46:56 - Patron : Might it be possible to download and share the file through Canvas without going through the library?
17:48:21 - Patron : Or is there an EBSCO sign in that everyone could use?
17:48:38 - Mark Dahlquist : I'm not sure if this would work quickly enough for your students, unfortunately. There is a contact email on that page for Carla Myers, who is the best contact person for this system. Carla is Miami's copyright librarian and can also advise on sharing this digitally on Canvas.<br />
17:49:33 - Mark Dahlquist : It might also be possible to purchase an ebook with wider access, but this would probably be a solution for future semesters, if possible.<br />
17:52:10 - Mark Dahlquist : I could forward a request for an umlimited user ebook to our psychology librarian, Megan Jaskowiak, if you'd like (or share her email address with you).<br />
17:52:11 - Patron : Ok, thanks, I will try to contact her but looks like they will not be able to use it within the next days. I'm concerned this will be the case for other resources this semester. Might you please tell me where this user limit is found on the library search page? I only saw the download page limit of 40 pages. Many thanks for the quick help!
17:53:25 - Patron : I can definitely attempt to contact both of those persons as well!
17:53:49 - Mark Dahlquist : Ok; hold on one moment, please, I will check on this title some more.<br />
17:56:14 - Mark Dahlquist : Yes, checking on this item, I do see the user limit is listed, though it is harder to spot than would be ideal. In this record it appears near the heading ""Concurrent User Level"" which I agree is not very clear : <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip&amp;db=nlebk&amp;AN=2226071&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip&amp;db=nlebk&amp;AN=2226071&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site</a><br />
17:57:18 - Mark Dahlquist : We will be transitioning to a new library interface later this year, which I hope will make this information easier to see and decipher.<br />
17:59:26 - Patron : Oh, I see it now, Mark! Thanks for that information, which will be very helpful for the future. Since this is already assigned I'll try to follow up with both Carla and Megan and cross my fingers. Thanks for the help!

13:13:07 - Zachary Grisham : The easiest way to find that should be via Mintel consumer data.
13:13:07 - Patron : thank you! what database should i be using?
13:13:17 - Zachary Grisham : Have you used the consumer data section yet?
13:14:32 - Patron : Yes I have, I think you came to one of my classes recently so I was using a report from Mintel and looking into the section with tables where you look more into demographics but I was wondering if there was anything else I could use to get more specific
13:14:55 - Zachary Grisham : Hmm, let me take a look. 
13:18:51 - Zachary Grisham : Alright, that is pretty specific demographic data in the consumer data sections, income levels, age range, ethnicity, gender, etc.. What type of demographics are you looking for? How specific? Any example?
13:19:58 - Zachary Grisham : Also, any specific occassions?<br />
13:21:53 - Patron : It was more so about the occasions. The report I looked at had more relaxed options as answers and this product for my project is more for use occasions that are more active
13:22:55 - Patron : Also the page I was looking at only had age and gender demographics, do you mind sharing what report/page you are looking at
13:23:15 - Zachary Grisham : Ah! That makes sense, you have to choose other variables as well as age and gender.
13:23:50 - Zachary Grisham : I do not believe I can share it via a screen grab on the chat service. Would be happy to show you via zoom or guide you through the process using chat.
13:24:29 - Zachary Grisham : If you access the report you mentioned I could tell you how to increase the segments.
13:24:51 - Patron : That's ok, I am at work right now can you guide me on how to do it?
13:25:03 - Zachary Grisham : Yep, can you access the Mintel report?
13:25:08 - Zachary Grisham : Let me know which one you chose.
13:25:12 - Zachary Grisham : I will look at it as well.
13:25:39 - Patron : yes the report is named Alcohol Use Occasion - US - 2024
13:25:49 - Zachary Grisham : Awesome, one moment
13:26:43 - Zachary Grisham : Alright, I found it!
13:26:52 - Zachary Grisham : If you look on the left hand side, access the consumer data.
13:27:32 - Zachary Grisham : Once you do that, which question did you pick?
13:29:07 - Patron : the question is ""which of the following activities do you typically do while drinking alcohol?""
13:29:35 - Zachary Grisham : Awesome, click on the explore demographics button.
13:29:37 - Zachary Grisham : It is blue
13:29:47 - Patron : ok
13:30:07 - Zachary Grisham : Next, click on the ""select demographics to include"" dropdown

13:30:36 - Zachary Grisham : employment, children, income, region, generation, etc..
13:30:51 - Patron : ohhh ok thank you that is very helpful
13:31:08 - Zachary Grisham : Does that fulfill your need? Or were you looking for something else
13:33:19 - Patron : this is great thanks!
13:34:15 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, you are welcome! Let us know if we can be of further help. If you wanted to explore more active hobbies and if those people drink you could also do that through MRI. It would be more correlational though. (For example, are hikers more likely to drink specific types of alchohol, etc..)

19:37:52 - Katie Gibson : Here's what their site says:Federal Work-Study<p>Federal Work-Study is a federal financial aid program that is based on financial need gathered from information provided on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Many departments prefer to hire work-study students since a portion of the employee’s wage is drawn from federal funds. Currently, federal funds contribute 65% of the student’s wages and the employing department pays the remaining 35%. Miami receives a limited amount of funding each year for work-study.</p><p>If you filed the FAFSA by Miami’s priority deadline and are eligible, your financial aid offer may include work-study. <em>Federal Work-Study earnings are not credited to your Bursar account</em>. Instead, you will receive a biweekly paycheck. If you were awarded work-study, you will have more job opportunities available. In addition, the work-study funds you earn won’t be calculated in the Expected Family Contribution (EFC)/Student Aid Index (SAI) on the upcoming year’s FAFSA.</p><p>If you submitted the FAFSA and are not sure whether you are eligible for work-study, inquire at the One Stop (513-529-0001 or <a href=""mailto:OneStop@MiamiOH.edu"">OneStop@MiamiOH.edu</a>).</p>

10:30:57 - Roger Justus : Then you can see we have it in the Education Research Complete database. And it lists all the years and issues we have access to

10:31:35 - Roger Justus : and on top above the Publication Details is a link for ""Search within this publication""
10:32:57 - Roger Justus : You can also enter JN ""Journal of Character Education"" in the first field of the advanced search on the homepage which can do a similar search
10:34:28 - Patron : Thanks, your assistance was very helpful and it saved me a lot of time. One last question. Is there a way to go a page where the journal's volumes are listed and where links can open up the volumes and display article titles?
10:36:11 - Roger Justus : Yes sort of, you can go to that link above and on the right hand side is a list of the years, which then can opened up for volumes and such.  Its a bit clunky, you have to open each manually but it works
10:36:29 - Roger Justus : You can also go to the journal webpage itself and do that - <a href=""https://www.infoagepub.com/journal-of-character-education.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.infoagepub.com/journal-of-character-education.html</a>
10:36:43 - Roger Justus : but you may need to go back to the library page to access

17:59:04 - Mark Dahlquist : I'm glad to help! :)  Are you looking for articles on this topic, or are more looking to find journals that focus on this topic in each issue?<br />
17:59:28 - Patron : journals that focus on this topic in each issue
17:59:36 - Patron : I don't even know if it is a thing
18:00:01 - Mark Dahlquist : Ok, give me a moment to do a search or to and I will share some results with you.<br />
18:00:09 - Patron : Thank you Sir!
18:00:12 - Patron : You are the best!
18:07:46 - Mark Dahlquist : Thanks for your patience! If you use the E-journals search tab on the library homepage, it provides some useful results.<br />
18:08:01 - Patron : Is it essentially like google??
18:09:03 - Mark Dahlquist : It's a much more limited search to journal only, I will share some results with you, though it seems like ESL/ELL articles appear in a quite a range of composition-related journals.<br />
18:10:25 - Mark Dahlquist : Generally speaking, it is looking like it's easier to search for articles on this topic using an Articles and More search, than to find journal on this topic. But there are some.<br />
18:11:48 - Patron : Awesome!
18:14:19 - Mark Dahlquist : It seems like most journals that mention ESL in their titles are focused on teaching English as a second language, rather than focusing on the needs of students for whom English is a second language.<br />
18:17:20 - Mark Dahlquist : It looks like bilingual education may be a better search term for this topic. Does that also fit with your research interest?<br />
18:17:48 - Patron : I think so???
18:21:29 - Mark Dahlquist : Would it be possible for me to email you a list of these in about 20 minutes? Apologies for the delay, but there are some technical issues on my end, unfortunately.<br />
18:21:40 - Mark Dahlquist : Thanks for your patience on this!<br />
18:22:17 - Patron : 100%
18:22:22 - Patron : I understand
18:22:29 - Patron : my Miami email will suffice
18:22:47 - Mark Dahlquist : Great, can you share that with me please?<br />
18:23:12 - Patron : benkenm@miamioh.edu

The journal title generally is broader than the article title, which describes the content of just the article itself. Does that help?
13:02:26 - Ginny Boehme : for example: <a href=""https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/istl/index.php/istl/article/view/2800"" target=""_blank"">https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/istl/index.php/istl/article/view/2800</a>

13:02:54 - Patron : I am struggling to find the journal vs the article title
13:03:08 - Ginny Boehme : do you have a specific piece you are looking at?

13:05:13 - Ginny Boehme : Were you able to find the Avery Index and search for this building?

I am on campus working from a computer in my office.","","20","","11:17:26 - Kristen Adams : Hi there
11:17:42 - Kristen Adams : Let me check and see if they are working for me
11:17:47 - Kristen Adams : which journal was it?
11:17:52 - Patron : Sargentia
11:18:50 - Kristen Adams : ok, I can check that one
11:19:05 - Kristen Adams : Global Plants is working for me on campus...
11:19:10 - Patron : I was trying to access the Botanicus Digital Library, which I have used many times.
11:20:13 - Kristen Adams : Ok. I'm also getting an error for Sargentia
11:20:32 - Patron : I can get to JSTOR Global Plants, and do a search, but get the message when I try to use the viewer so I can see enlarged details of a specimen.
11:20:39 - Patron : We're sorry. You don't appear to have permission to access the item.
Full access to these resources typically requires affiliation with a partnering organization. (For example, researchers are often granted access through their affiliation with a university library.)

11:20:45 - Kristen Adams : oh I see
11:22:31 - Kristen Adams : Does this link to the jouranl work for you? <a href=""https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/7544"" target=""_blank"">https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/7544</a>
11:23:21 - Patron : I can access Sargentia via Biodiversity Heritage Library, but have to download a full copy of a volume to see what I need.  The other resource allows me to view a single article.
11:23:45 - Kristen Adams : I double checked with someone and Global Plant might not be working because it's in a cancelation process right now. So our access will be ending soon, and that might be the cause of the error we are both seeing.
11:24:07 - Patron : Oh no!  That is a really important resource for me.
11:24:21 - Kristen Adams : per Sargentia - I can report that access issue via Botanicus
11:24:46 - Kristen Adams : Sorry to have to share that news with you
11:25:23 - Patron : That will cause research in the herbarium t6o be much more difficult, if not nearly impossible.
11:26:21 - Kristen Adams : Again, I'm sorry. The library's budget situation is necessitating us do a through review of our subscriptions and cancel a number of resources across disciplines. 
11:28:29 - Patron : Well, thanks for your assistance.

I’m currently writing a research paper about gender representation in the 1970s TV show M*A*S*H*. I found a few journal articles related to the show, but nothing that also related to my topic. I’d like to discuss how the show’s characters break from typical sitcom archetypes of the time period, but my evidence is currently anecdotal, and it’s been hard to find academic sources. I also want to discuss second wave feminism and the gay liberation movement in the 1970s. In that regard, the problem is that I’ve found an overwhelming amount of research. Would it be possible to talk to a librarian about the best way to go about continuing to my research?

19:51:30 - Patron : and there are like 10000
19:53:17 - Barry Zaslow : You could start with Academic Search Complete which is one of the first ones in the A section under Databases A-Z. That one has lots of useful articles and you can put in keywords in the search box such as ""coffee"" and whatever else you think is useful. Also you can limit by years (if you want something recent), and language (probably English). Does this help?
19:54:55 - Patron : ok thank you!
19:55:17 - Barry Zaslow : You're welcome. If you get too many matches, try narrowing it down a bit more.
19:56:12 - Barry Zaslow : Maybe coffee from a certain country or just a company like Starbucks if that's relevant or limit to just the last 5 years...

Your best bet is to call the Circulation Desk at 513-529-4141 and ask to speak to a staff member who can check on this. There is a list of available tech on the library home page but sometimes it's not up to date.

Of course these are in use on and off during the school year so probably still best to interact with the people there
11:13:41 - Barry Zaslow : The main library (King) is open 7am-1am every day except holidays and there is almost always an adult supervisor around.
11:25:34 - Barry Zaslow : Kylie--Since I have not heard back from you in 15 minutes I'm going to close the chat window now. Hope you get your tech needs addressed.

13:50:37 - Patron : The pathways program is a program for Miami University students that are not fully admitted into the main Oxford campus but live and take classes on the main campus. The Pathways students need to get a 2.00 GPA in their first semester in order to be admitted into the main campus in the second semester.
13:51:05 - Patron : So I was planning on talking about how these students feel academicalky pressured to maintain good grades
13:51:05 - Kristen Adams : I see,
13:51:35 - Kristen Adams : as that's a Miami specific name for the program, finding scholarly articles will likely be a challenge
13:52:09 - Kristen Adams : I wonder if there are similar programs at other schools too, and there's a broader term for programs like this?
13:53:09 - Patron : Not that I know of. I can send the link from the Miami website that gives a brief explanation of what the program is

13:53:38 - Patron : Yes that is it
13:55:02 - Kristen Adams : Ok, I'm not sure that Miami has data to share on these students - if so they'd probably share it on this site somewhere, and I am unsure what the broad kind of program like this would be called - but that's what would be helpful in searching the academic literature

Do you have any books on how to fix that?","","29","","18:34:20 - Mark Dahlquist : Hi, thanks for this question Please hold on a moment while I check on this.<br />
18:36:41 - Mark Dahlquist : Are you in Oxford? The Miami Libraries don't seem to have many how-to books on wood finishing, but these are available at the local Lane library that Miami students can use.<br />
18:37:20 - Patron : I am in Hamilton.
18:37:53 - Patron : Are there books that would help me figure out what kind of furniture I have?
18:38:35 - Mark Dahlquist : I<br />
18:39:21 - Mark Dahlquist : Hmm hold on one moment, please.<br />
18:40:44 - Mark Dahlquist : I'm not sure whether this dresser is an antique, but here is an older title that might be a starting point: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip&amp;db=cat00344a&amp;AN=mucat.b1338325&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip&amp;db=cat00344a&amp;AN=mucat.b1338325&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site</a><br />
18:41:01 - Mark Dahlquist : Especially if your dresser is from before 1900.<br />
18:41:35 - Patron : Well it belonged to my great great grandfather so I think it might be?
18:42:40 - Patron : What kind of things should I search on the public library website to help me find stuff on the finishing part of my project? Since miami doesnt have much on how to do things
18:44:00 - Mark Dahlquist : I tried searching ""wood finishing"" (without the quotation marks) at the Lane library and it came back with several good hits.<br />
18:44:24 - Patron : Cool. I'll try that.
18:45:11 - Mark Dahlquist : Great; I see that there is also a 1997 version of The Connoisseur's guide to antique furniture, but it is hard to find--not in OhioLINK or in Lane, I think.

<br />
18:45:54 - Mark Dahlquist : But that might be something to look for if the 1969 guide is too old.<br />
18:46:31 - Patron : If its not at miami or lane how could I get it?
18:46:53 - Mark Dahlquist : Good question! Hold on for a minute while I do some more searching, please.<br />
18:49:59 - Mark Dahlquist : Hmm; it looks like a good alternative would be the Field Guide to Antique Furniture, by Joseph T. Butler.<br />
18:51:04 - Mark Dahlquist : Here's a link to this in OhioLINK: <a href=""https://olc1.ohiolink.edu/record=b11162850"" target=""_blank"">https://olc1.ohiolink.edu/record=b11162850</a><br />

18:52:51 - Patron : Wait do you think that would work for Italian furniture
18:53:26 - Patron : I'm not sure if there is a difference but I just wanted to be sure
18:53:53 - Mark Dahlquist : Hmm hold on for a moment.<br />
18:56:51 - Mark Dahlquist : Hmm; there is a book, ""Field Guide to Antique Furniture,"" by Peter Philip that also covers European Furniture, but it is not in OhioLINK or SearchOhio. You can buy it for $5.15 on Abe.com however with free shipping.<br />

21:00:43 - Patron : I am researching Brazil! The source guidelines are the following You must consult at least 10 legitimate sources – these might include RSF’s World Freedom
Index, Freedom House, CIA Factbook, BBC’s country profile, or a report by a group such as the
Committee to Protect Journalism. Wikipedia is good starting point, but is not a legitimate source for this assignment. I am looking at what a foreign reporter may be interested in knwoing about Brazil such as local
politics, cultural understandings of journalism, major foreign policy issues, and relations with the United States.
21:01:14 - Mark Dahlquist : Great; I will try to answer this. We may be cut off shortly after 9pm; if so I will email you some information.<br />

21:11:03 - Mark Dahlquist : For NexisUni, you will need to run a search first and then limit your results to Brazil.<br />

21:13:23 - Mark Dahlquist : Thanks again for your question. I hope that these resources are helpful! <br />

13:54:15 - Katie Gibson : My guess is years ago we had to condense our microform collections and this got removed. But somehow WorldCat didn't get updated. 
13:54:22 - Patron : ok! Speaking of, I've had some confusion about microform. Is that typically something I can request to have shipped to Miami's library for pickup, or is that for in-library use only?
13:55:18 - Katie Gibson : You can generally request it, yes. But, you need a specialized machine to read it. We have some of those on the ground floor in the IMC (that area at the back of the cafe)
13:55:32 - Patron : ok, wonderful. thank you very much!
13:55:38 - Katie Gibson : you're welcome!
13:55:45 - Katie Gibson : try requesting the microform through OhioLINK

Cultural evolution differs from biological evolution not only by inheritance of acquired characteristics but also, as is proposed in the present essay, by another kind of selection mechanism. Whereas selection in biological evolution is executed according to a criterion of reproductive Success (the natural selection), selection ill Cultural evolution appears to be carried Out according to human and humanistic criteria (success or fitness in meeting human needs, interests and humanistic values - ""humanistic selection"").

The databases are off the main library page <a href=""http://www.lib.miamioh.edu"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lib.miamioh.edu</a> using the little button saying Databases A-Z.

12:46:11 - Barry Zaslow : You can also limit by years (perhaps the last 5-10) so you don't get hundreds of matches. It also lets you choose the type of material so if you want just articles from journals rather than books or conferences you can do that

15:28:15 - Patron : I think I have the wrong page numbers for the first article. I need pages 336 to 350 and I'm seeing different pages
15:28:44 - Patron : I think I'm viewing a description of the article instead of the article itself.
15:29:49 - Ginny Boehme : Are you on a page that says ""Wiley Online Library"" with a Miami Libraries logo next to it, all the way at the top of the page?
15:31:37 - Patron : yes. I don't see the different sections of the research article like the introduction and methods section. I think I'm seeing the wrong pages of the publication.
15:32:41 - Ginny Boehme : You're actually seeing a different format of the article, one that's styled for the web and not for print. Do you see, just above the Abstract section heading, a ""PDF"" icon and link?

15:36:19 - Ginny Boehme : Is this the top of page you are seeing?
15:38:29 - Patron : I'm seeing the correct pages. There is no introduction and methods section and that is why I've been confused.
15:39:12 - Ginny Boehme : Correct. This doesn't appear to be a primary research article, where you would expect to see those sections
15:40:35 - Patron : Yes. I don't think this article fits into the assignment that I'm working on but I used this article for the last assignment and my instructor is telling me to use it again for this assignment but it's not the right type of article so I'll have to contact her and ask her what to do.
15:41:25 - Ginny Boehme : Yes, probably a good plan. It looks like a peer-reviewed article, but if you specifically need primary research, then this does not fit that criterion
15:41:41 - Patron : Yes. Thank you.

11:22:58 - Kristen Adams : let's try GoogleBooks actually and see if they have anything

11:24:46 - Kristen Adams : and it gives us the author and date, which will help
11:25:46 - Patron : I think the 1956 version is the one I am looking for, with this link <a href=""https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/11h5IwkXdGoC?hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjFoNv8paKJAxUYM1kFHbVhG5oQ7_IDegQIEhAC"" target=""_blank"">https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/11h5IwkXdGoC?hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjFoNv8paKJAxUYM1kFHbVhG5oQ7_IDegQIEhAC</a>
11:26:03 - Patron : However, I could not locate where to buy or access the book
11:27:12 - Kristen Adams : Ok, this helps. 
11:27:31 - Kristen Adams : Let's try this record in WorldCat

11:27:50 - Kristen Adams : are you with Miami or are you somewhere else?
11:28:07 - Patron : I am a miamioh dormitory resident
11:28:38 - Patron : But I would be willing to ship or purchase the book from a distance, or a shipped loan
11:28:51 - Kristen Adams : Ok. I would try InterLibrary Loan.
11:28:57 - Kristen Adams : you can login here <a href=""https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html"" target=""_blank"">https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html</a>
11:30:07 - Kristen Adams : use the info from the WorldCat record to fill out the request
11:30:10 - Kristen Adams : it's free
11:30:24 - Patron : I had asked this library, and was able to access a free ebook, but was only given access to, bizzarely, a single page of review
11:31:33 - Kristen Adams : the review is what shows up in our catalog when you do a search for the title
11:32:00 - Kristen Adams : If you do the InterLibrary Loan request you can specify you want the book and they can ship it to King for you to pickup
11:32:10 - Patron : Ahh, I see, thank you
11:32:15 - Kristen Adams : your welcome

11:38:22 - Nate Floyd : One second....
11:39:01 - Patron : Okay!
11:40:06 - Nate Floyd : So, I think our biology (Ginny boehmemv@miamioh.edu) librarian is probably your best bet, longterm, but I can take a shot at this
11:40:31 - Nate Floyd : Have you settled on a current event? 
11:40:59 - Patron : No.
11:41:22 - Patron : I don't know what a good one could be.
11:41:25 - Nate Floyd : But it has to include a micro organism 
11:41:50 - Patron : Yes, a microbe has to be involved.
11:41:58 - Nate Floyd : I know there's a Marburg virus outbreak right now in Africa 
11:42:01 - Nate Floyd : That's in the news 
11:42:15 - Nate Floyd : You could probably just search NY Times for ""Marburg virus"" 
11:42:20 - Nate Floyd : or search news.google.com 
11:42:41 - Nate Floyd : <a href=""https://news.google.com/search?for=marburg+virus&amp;hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US%3Aen"" target=""_blank"">https://news.google.com/search?for=marburg+virus&amp;hl=en-US&amp;gl=US&amp;ceid=US%3Aen</a>
11:42:53 - Patron : I can use that!
11:43:05 - Nate Floyd : Good luck w your work! 
11:49:00 - Patron : I emailed my professor to see if that article is okay but just incase he doesn't get back in time. Is this article okay to use with the instructions he stated "" Reports based on web ""fact"" pages (i.e. encyclopedia-like pages, Wikipedia, etc.) will not be accepted.
Articles from professional medical or microbiology journals will not be accepted.""
11:51:56 - Nate Floyd : My sense here is that professor wants something from a mainstream news source (""Your current event report should be prepared from something in the news""). And he specifically doesn't want academic/scholarly work or encyclopedia-like pages, Wikipedia, etc. So, something from NY Times, or the Wall Street Journal, or CNN, or something like that should work. My guess is the professor wants to have a discussion about how mainstream journalism covers highly technical things like this (hint: not great!). 
11:53:12 - Nate Floyd : Something like this I would think would work: <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/05/world/africa/rwanda-marburg-doctors-and-nurses.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/05/world/africa/rwanda-marburg-doctors-and-nurses.html</a>

15:37:06 - Stefanie Hilles : Ok. So you want something general on Pop art?
15:37:17 - Patron : yes if thats possible!
15:39:05 - Stefanie Hilles : Well, here are the results for Pop art. It's hard to tell what will be most helpful for you from the records, though. I suggest you come to the library to see if they are what you're looking for: <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip,url,uid,cpid&amp;custid=s9002934&amp;bquery=Pop+art&amp;cli0=FT1&amp;clv0=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;profile=eds_cat"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip,url,uid,cpid&amp;custid=s9002934&amp;bquery=Pop+art&amp;cli0=FT1&amp;clv0=Y&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;profile=eds_cat</a>
15:39:39 - Stefanie Hilles : I would guess the 2 and 4 are general but, as I said, it is hard to tell
15:40:19 - Patron : what is a catalog record?
15:40:55 - Stefanie Hilles : That is the listing for the book in the catalog. So, if you click on the title of a book on that list, you will see the record. 
15:42:07 - Stefanie Hilles : As for articles, it is going to be challenging to find something general on pop art that wouldn't be too general for your purposes. Articles tend to be more narrow in scope
15:42:34 - Patron : okay

The four sources out of eight which I've found are all but one, effectively inaccessible. They either cannot be traced online, do not exist online, or some other odd outstanding issue. Is there a way I can filter it down to articles that I can actually access?","","20","","10:59:03 - Kristen Adams : Hi there
10:59:12 - Patron : Hello
10:59:27 - Kristen Adams : So you have some citations that you can't find?
10:59:53 - Patron : Yes
11:00:50 - Kristen Adams : Can you share them with me? I can try to find them
11:00:56 - Patron : Sure
11:02:12 - Patron : The links I've copied off the library website don't actually take you to the page where the article is located. So I will just have to send you the name of the article, and the author if necessary
11:02:20 - Kristen Adams : that's fine
11:02:27 - Patron : “Predicting Food Waste Reduction Behavior among Students in Higher Education Institutions"", is one
11:03:17 - Kristen Adams : Ok, found that one
11:03:27 - Kristen Adams : you are right, we don't have the full text to it
11:04:05 - Kristen Adams : if you click on the yellow find it button at the side of the article page, it'll direct you to a page where ther'es a link to InterLibrary Loan
11:04:26 - Kristen Adams : it's listed under 'Request Item'
11:04:40 - Kristen Adams : this is free but does take a few days
11:06:22 - Patron : I have placed a request already. I only have 6 days to complete this assignment and no way of knowing whether or not I will receive it in that time frame. Another source which I attempted to request, says that it is ""awaiting copyright clearance"". For the sake of time, is there any way I can limit my search results to items that are actually accessible?
11:08:06 - Kristen Adams : another option, for this one I looked up, and possibly others, but not all, is the 'Need it right away?' option just below InterLibrary Loan. 
11:08:18 - Kristen Adams : this is more quick, usually a few hours or less
11:08:29 - Kristen Adams : It's called Get it Now
11:09:43 - Kristen Adams : In terms of limiting your searches, you can also do that. Once you do a search in the OneSearch or Articles and More, there is a box at the left to 'limit to full text'
11:09:47 - Kristen Adams : and that will help

Have you tried Academic Search Complete database yet?
18:42:22 - Patron : I tried Google Scholar .I am just writing an argumentative essay and I found 4 essays that support my idea ,now I am trying to find a contra argument but I didn't have any success on that .
18:42:47 - Patron : My argument is about fast fashion and violation of human rights
18:46:03 - Barry Zaslow : Stefanie, the Art/Architecture Librarian recommends Business Source Complete as a possible index as well. Also we have Fashion Snopes and the Vogue Archive in Databases A-Z which might help. For example, in Business Source I did a sample search using ""fast fashion"" and ""human rights"" in the text boxes, searching anywhere in the text and got a number of matches (over 400). You could limit to just the last few years, or just peer-reviewed, or another modifier. Do you think this will help?
18:47:11 - Patron : could you sned me the link or where can I look up for those please?Is it in the Miami Univerisity Database?
18:48:44 - Barry Zaslow : If you go to <a href=""http://www.lib.miamioh.edu"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lib.miamioh.edu</a>, the home page, then there is a button saying Databases A-Z, and you can choose the one you want to try. They are alphabetical so Academic Search is in the ""A"" section and Business Source in ""B"" but you could also just put their name in the box at the top as well. 
18:49:21 - Patron : thank you so much.I will do that
18:49:45 - Barry Zaslow : You're welcome. Hope this is useful and you find some counter-arguments.

My question is regarding citations.
For the sentence:The book The Sacred in Twentieth-Century Politics by Payne et.al has a chapter which discusses Cuba’s approach to religion and Castroism.
Is Payne et.al the correct way of referencing 2+ authors intext in Chicago style?","","18","","15:18:26 - Stefanie Hilles : Let me check!
15:21:42 - Stefanie Hilles : So, I am not finding any reference to how that should be cited within a sentence BUT in a bibliography or footnote, you don't use et. al until you have 4 or more authors
15:22:47 - Patron : Ok so there is 4 authors, the citation is :Payne, Stanley G, Robert Mallett, Roger Griffin, and John S Tortorice. 2008. The Sacred in Twentieth-Century Politics : Essays in Honour of Professor Stanley G. Payne. Palgrave Macmillan. <a href=""https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip&amp;db=cat00344a&amp;AN=mucat.b3981220&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip&amp;db=cat00344a&amp;AN=mucat.b3981220&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site</a>.
15:23:27 - Stefanie Hilles : Then et al is what you would use since there is 4
15:24:00 - Patron : okay!, Do I need to put the date? I know sometimes in APA you do but I wasn't sure about Chicago
15:25:44 - Stefanie Hilles : Are you asking whether you need to put the date in the sentence or in the footnote or in the bibliography?
15:26:00 - Patron : in the sentence like Payne et.al (2008)
15:26:42 - Stefanie Hilles : Are you using Author/Date Chicago Style or traditional style?
15:27:12 - Patron : hmmm, the assignment just says chicago style...
15:27:14 - Stefanie Hilles : Basically, are you using footnotes or parenthetical citations?
15:27:21 - Patron : im doing footnotes
15:27:30 - Stefanie Hilles : Gotchu
15:28:18 - Stefanie Hilles : If you are using footnotes, you do not need to include the date in the sentence. You CAN, if you want to. But you do not need to. The reason it is in APA in a sentence is because that is part of the citation. With Chicago, that part will be in the footnote
15:28:47 - Patron : Gotchu, I understand now thank you so much for your help!
15:29:20 - Stefanie Hilles : No problem! Also, here is our Chicago Style Libguide, if you haven't seen it yet: <a href=""https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/citation/chicago"" target=""_blank"">https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/citation/chicago</a>

15:30:26 - Patron : nope! I should be good!

15:20:14 - Barry Zaslow : The university just changed their employment system to Workday on July 1, 2024.

I am trying to figure out what the difference is between the two and where to find them.","","9","","17:42:34 - Barry Zaslow : Hello. Depending on your topic, most of the databases in the A-Z listing on the library home page have a way to check a box to limit to peer reviewed articles which means that the journal sends the proposed article out to a group of reviewers before it is allowed to be published. A secondary source could be a peer reviewed article but doesn't have to be. It can be anything like a news report about an event, or a book about a person. This just differentiates it from a primary source which would be someone's autobiography or diary or letters. Does this help?
17:43:18 - Patron : Yes, that helps a lot! So, could a secondary source also be a scientific website?
17:44:55 - Barry Zaslow : That depends. If the website is showing the actual scientific findings the researchers did that would more likely be primary, but if the website has commentary or reactions those would be secondary. It's a bit different for science than for humanities or social science topics. I hope this isn't too confusing.
17:45:16 - Barry Zaslow : Meaning reactions from other authors, not ""chemical"" reactions!
17:47:05 - Patron : Okay! It is definitely making more sense. I guess I should have clarified that I am asking because I am writing a scientific report. So, basically the secondary sources are giving their opinions/facts on a topic, but they do not have to be peer-reviewed?
17:48:46 - Barry Zaslow : I'm not sure about the last part since it depends on your professor or assignment. Many secondary sources are peer-reviewed especially in academic journals, but if the Washington Post did an article about your scientists and the exciting new discoveries that would be a secondary source but not peer-reviewed.
17:49:29 - Patron : Oh, got it. This has been very helpful. Thank you so much for your help!
17:50:09 - Barry Zaslow : You're welcome. I hope you can find some useful sources in both areas. We have people here till 9pm tonight if you get stuck later.

10:28:58 - Patron : Is it possible for my students find this through the library page?
10:29:36 - Andy Revelle : Click on databases A-Z, then on K across the top. It's the first link
10:29:41 - Patron : No one knew about the resource when I referenced it in class and I spent &gt;5 min serarchign for it just a moment ago.
10:31:35 - Patron : Interesting.  I've always ignored this list because any thing (papers, usually) that I might find there is easier to find through the search bar (or google scholar)
10:32:09 - Patron : When I looked for Kanopy in that usual way, I got articles and user guides but not the site
10:32:29 - Andy Revelle : That's what you would get. 
10:32:58 - Patron : Are there other resources that you'd liek students to know about /use more that are buried in this section?
10:33:51 - Patron : My concern is that one needs to knw a resources exists and what its name is in order to even try to look for it.
10:35:50 - Andy Revelle : We currently have 443 electronic databases and online collections. One of our challenges is awareness. I always show students NYT Historical if they are humanities/social science students and Visible Body if they are interested in health/medicine
10:37:39 - Patron : NYT a good one.  The log in is a pain.  I will emphasixe that in class today.  I had no idea we had a visible body account that was available beyond the tables.  I will reference that a lot in the future.  Thank you.
10:38:16 - Andy Revelle : No problem. I plan to create a series of videos on our databases and collections to increase awareness. 
10:39:16 - Patron : I'm looking at Kanopy today because PBS is down.  I'd like to use <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/culture/keys-to-the-kingdom-the-story-of-a-revolutionary-taxidermist/5036/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/culture/keys-to-the-kingdom-the-story-of-a-revolutionary-taxidermist/5036/</a> it looks like that's not on Kanopy and the alternatives do not address what I'm looking for.  Do you think there's another source for this?
10:39:32 - Andy Revelle : Let me see what I can find
10:41:51 - Patron : We need instagrams or other short promos for the resources--something quick and promotional and easy for students to see with little effort.  Maybe these link to the videos.  If you ever want to use Museum objects, I can help.  Something like ""I have a question bout this thing...""  ""Here's the database to use!""
10:44:46 - Andy Revelle : I'm not seeing any access to that video in our collections
10:46:33 - Andy Revelle : Is this it?

10:48:08 - Patron : Sorry, had an office visitor.
10:49:07 - Patron : No, the one I need is about Karl Akeley and his revolutions in taxidermy.  I was hoping that, since Kanopy hosts some PBS stuff, it might be there.  PBS is down today, it seems, so I need another source.
10:49:42 - Patron : I found an interview about Akeley that can work for class, it just lacks the images.
10:51:40 - Patron : Wait a  minute!  When I access PBS through the link you sent, PBS is not down.  But when I access through a search or the link from my syllabus I get the message ""PBS is Temporarily Unavailable
We're sorry, PBS.org is currently experiencing connectivity issues. Please try refreshing the page or check back again later. We will be up and running again as soon as possible.""
10:53:42 - Patron : My students are also getting this message.
10:53:57 - Andy Revelle : What's the title of the video?
10:54:20 - Patron : That said, I cant find keys to the kingdom the story of a revolutionary taxidermist
10:55:06 - Patron : I did find a short video that can supplement the interview.
10:55:47 - Andy Revelle : I can't find any reference to that video, even in WorldCAT.
10:57:44 - Andy Revelle : I have a meeting that i have to switch over to. Your best course of action is to send an email to your subject librarian. They can search out that video and purchase access to it.
10:57:55 - Patron : Thanks for your help!

How can I get access to this journal? Thank you!","","9","","14:20:39 - Barry Zaslow : Hello. Let me see what I can find for this. Please hold on.
14:28:11 - Barry Zaslow : Mary--I'm not finding anything with this combination of author and title. Do you recall where you found the document?
14:29:15 - Patron : I found it under the journals and articles section of the library website. It sent me to a link that asked me to pay to read the whole document
14:29:36 - Barry Zaslow : Can you forward the link to me?

14:35:22 - Barry Zaslow : I did not see any way to view this online right now but you can try Interlibrary Loan here: <a href=""https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html"" target=""_blank"">https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html</a>. If you have not used this free service create a new account with your unique ID/password, then choose ""new request"" ""article"" and put the citation in the boxes. Look on the right of the screen you shared with me for the name of the journal, issue number, date, pages. The staff will try to find it at another university library who will scan it as a PDF and you will get an e-mail with a link. Hope this makes sense.
14:36:18 - Patron : It does make sense, thank you so much! Happy Halloween!!

16:58:41 - Ginny Boehme : is this an interview with a patient, or a parent, or something?
16:59:57 - Patron : I primarily mean a conversation between two people who would be acquaintances.
17:01:15 - Patron : And by a conversation not going well, I mean that it is not running smoothly and has several, long gaps. It could also be that people are experiencing the conversation as going poorly.

17:06:21 - Ginny Boehme : maybe result number 9? that sounds like it might be what you're interested in?
17:16:59 - Patron : Number 9 does not seem like what I am looking for because of how it seems to be about giving autistic children more autonomy in order to help them better express their feelings. I am more so looking for behaviors being shown inside of a conversation while it is occurring. These could include uncontrollable signs as well, like hormones or heart rate along with nonverbal behaviors like increased fidgeting behavior.
17:18:27 - Ginny Boehme : Ok, then you may need to reach out to our librarian subject specialist for psych and speech path. Her name is Megan Jaskowiak and her email is jaskowma@miamioh.edu

16:56:52 - Zachary Grisham : On it is the search tool. 
16:57:04 - Zachary Grisham : For most basic research it will be your best friend.
16:57:10 - Zachary Grisham : What are you doing research on?
16:57:45 - Patron : The history of western dress more specifically a cultural report done on the 80s
16:58:22 - Zachary Grisham : Well I am betting that we have quite a bit on the subject. How in-depth does your research need to be? 
16:59:32 - Zachary Grisham : For example, this might be useful

17:01:21 - Zachary Grisham : Apologies though, I did not let you answer the question. Do you know how in-depth your research needs to be?
17:01:51 - Patron : It needs to be pretty detailed

16:59:39 - Zachary Grisham : That is a good and fun question. Would depend on how you are defining their industry and what the charachteristics of that industry are.
17:00:14 - Zachary Grisham : As an example, a highly concentrated industry might have national competitors while more fractured industries might make it better to focus on regional ones.
17:00:30 - Zachary Grisham : So. How are you defining the industry and what product are you focusing on?

My focus is more so on specific offerings, engagement, distribution and the logistics of those specific competitors, but Im not sure if i have clearly defined the market, or what that necessarily entails.
17:03:41 - Zachary Grisham : No worries! So it might be worth looking into IBISWorld to see the larger coffee production industry in the US
17:03:55 - Zachary Grisham : That will give you more insight into the structure and general state of the industry. 
17:04:14 - Zachary Grisham : For example, what type of coffee tends to be sold the most and if that is what Rooted Grounds sells
17:04:39 - Zachary Grisham : Can you get into that database really quick?
17:05:27 - Patron : I am working on that. One second
17:05:46 - Zachary Grisham : No problem, once you are in type in coffee and it will pull up an industry report.
17:09:09 - Patron : Most common in the industry as a whole is in-store beverages which can definitely be looked into to in order to understand the jist of the entire industry and what consumers like. Still looking for individual and speciic products
17:10:08 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, so the store is less about producing coffee and more about a coffee shop?
17:11:45 - Patron : Not necessarily. I can probably let you go for now and ask more questions when I get more specifics. I need to do more individual looking around before I get back on here. Thank you for your help!

17:16:40 - Zachary Grisham : Is there a reason you were only interested in that paper, or were you looking for any primary document on the artist?
17:16:57 - Patron : I need a primary document on the artist
17:18:07 - Zachary Grisham : Ok, how did they define that? Newspapers only, autobiography, a letter from the artist? 
17:19:28 - Patron : Any of those sources would be great. There's a good chance there isn't anything on the artist specifically because he wasn't that well known, so any source from his time period would be helpful.
17:19:52 - Patron : Specifically 1870 because that is around when he completed the painting I'm studying
17:20:45 - Zachary Grisham : Yea, have been doing a bit of research while we have been chatting. I think you are correct.

Can you tell me a bit more about the requirements for sources?
19:24:04 - Patron : Sources may include a variety of scholarly journal articles, news, books, and websites. At least three must be peer-reviewed academic articles or books, and every source you use needs to pass the CRAAP testLinks to an external site. (Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, and Purpose).

19:36:15 - Ginny Boehme : You're welcome. ""Best"" is a relative term here. You may not find good sources on exactly the topic you start with, so it's going to require your thinking about what interests you about the topic and narrowing in on those ideas. Is it the impact on poor communities? The possible environmental drivers of high housing prices? Something else? You will need to look at the titles and abstracts of these papers (and maybe others) to see what interesting things stand out to you

10:32:24 - Kristen Adams : for this particular article, but not to the whole encyclopedia 
10:32:38 - Patron : ok perfect
10:32:50 - Kristen Adams : and as it's to Miami's catalog, you'll need to signin with Miami credentials in order for the link to work...
10:33:11 - Kristen Adams : so if it's for a class assignment it'll be fine
10:33:28 - Kristen Adams : if it's for something outside a class, I'd be more hesitant to use that one

12:56:14 - Katie Gibson : I can get you started, but you'll probably want to meet with our History librarian, Jenny Presnell

12:57:05 - Katie Gibson : The topic is very broad... are you looking at any particular places or time periods?
12:57:29 - Katie Gibson : Like slavery in classical times is going to look much different than slavery in modern india for example
12:57:41 - Katie Gibson : and the best places to search will be as well
12:58:09 - Katie Gibson : but to start off, you'll want to look at Historical Abstracts and search slavery and one of the places you are interested in
12:58:18 - Patron : More of the 19th Century.
12:58:29 - Katie Gibson : ok... and in any particular places?
12:59:11 - Patron : China, The  British Empire, South America possibly.
13:00:15 - Katie Gibson : In Historical Abstracts (link is on the History research guide) - go ahead and put one of the places in the first search box and then slavery in the next one. Then below the search boxes, use the Time Period section to put in the dates you're interested in so in this case 1800-1899. 
13:00:34 - Katie Gibson : That will get you articles about slavery in that place in the time period you want
13:01:40 - Katie Gibson : Then, in your search results, use the yellow find it button to locate full text of the articles, if there isn't a link to a .pdf 
13:02:21 - Katie Gibson : If there is no full text when you click the find it button, you'll get a link to request the article... that's free for you and when you log into the request system, the form should be automatically filled out for you. All you have to do is push submit.
13:03:12 - Patron : I'm on the Regional Libraries page.  Am I in the right area?
13:03:35 - Katie Gibson : Are you a regionals student?
13:03:41 - Katie Gibson : If so, which campus?
13:05:11 - Patron : Yes, Hamilton.
13:05:39 - Katie Gibson : Ok, in that case... on the top of the page where it says ""start searching"" go to Databases A-Z
13:05:50 - Katie Gibson : then, in that list, choose Historical Abstracts
13:06:23 - Katie Gibson : Let me know when you are that far, and I'll talk you through the rest
13:08:43 - Patron : Okay, I'm there.
13:09:35 - Katie Gibson : Ok, good! So now in one of the search boxes put slavery and in the next one pick one of the places you're interested in. Then scroll down and there
13:09:37 - Katie Gibson : oops
13:10:20 - Katie Gibson : Then scroll down and there is an area to add more to your search. One of those is ""Historical Period"" in that part put the dates of history you're interested in... so 1800-1899 for the 19th century
13:10:25 - Katie Gibson : then run your search
13:11:22 - Katie Gibson : You'll probably have to different searches for every place you want to research. 
13:14:35 - Katie Gibson : I'm actually one of the librarians in Oxford... I'd recommend you reach out to the Hamilton Campus librarians if you have additional questions while you search. Their chat is: <a href=""https://www.ham.miamioh.edu/library/services/get-help/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ham.miamioh.edu/library/services/get-help/</a>
13:16:14 - Patron : Okay.  I've done some searching, but don't quite know how to specifically search for those for and against slavery in the 17th and 18th centuries.  Do you think my search is to broad?
13:17:07 - Katie Gibson : Hm, maybe think of additional search terms like abolition that you can add to get at that idea
13:17:23 - Katie Gibson : sometimes you have to play around and add some terms to get at the right thing.
13:17:48 - Katie Gibson : And change the dates in the historical period area of the search to get 17th and 18th centuries too
13:19:28 - Patron : Okay.  Thank you, I'll work with this.
13:19:54 - Katie Gibson : you're welcome! Reach out to the librarians in Hamilton too... they are probably familiar with your assignment and professor too

16:11:16 - Katie Gibson : There might be a class research guide I can send to you
16:11:55 - Patron : Bio 206, I had done research prior but now that I am checking out for 4 primary literature and 4 secondary literatures, it turn out that some of my secondary literatures are considered primary
16:12:07 - Katie Gibson : ah ok
16:12:30 - Katie Gibson : So for secondary sources you want articles that aren't original research studies
16:12:52 - Katie Gibson : so if there is a format that has a methodology, results, discussion, etc. it's probably a primary source
16:13:23 - Patron : I used Web of Science, and some had said reviewed, which are secondary, but while verifying in Ulrich, it said they were primary
16:14:02 - Katie Gibson : It really depends on the articles themselves and Ulrich's only looks at the journal level
16:14:13 - Katie Gibson : So you might have some secondary sources
16:16:47 - Patron : Oh okay then. Yes, because the formatting were not primary, and it had a reviewed mark on web of science. I just wanted to make sure because Ulrich had told me something else, which got me in a panic mode.
16:17:14 - Katie Gibson : Yeah, Ulrich's is a very confusing database. The most it can tell you is if a journal is peer reviewed
16:17:52 - Patron : So for secondary literature, if I mark review articles only, it will be secondary literature on the Web of Science?
16:18:34 - Katie Gibson : I'm less familiar with that database and because I'm a humanities librarian, but I think so? 
16:18:49 - Katie Gibson : Let me see if I can double check that with our Biology librarian.

09:59:02 - Zachary Grisham : The easiest place to start is on the library website with the search tool.
09:59:04 - Zachary Grisham : One moment.
09:59:16 - Zachary Grisham : <a href=""https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/</a>
09:59:39 - Zachary Grisham : simply type in some keywords that fit your interests and it will pull up all of those resources.
09:59:44 - Zachary Grisham : What are you interested in?
10:00:11 - Patron : My topic is Skills and experiences you can develop by engaging in liberal education
10:00:44 - Zachary Grisham : By liberal education do you mean at a liberal arts college?
10:00:53 - Zachary Grisham : If so, that should not be too difficult to find.
10:00:58 - Patron : yes
10:01:47 - Zachary Grisham : Perfect, I would use the keywords. ""Liberal Arts"" AND College AND (skill OR experience)
10:01:51 - Zachary Grisham : Let me see what we get.
10:02:01 - Zachary Grisham : Btw, notice I put quotation marks around liberal arts
10:02:12 - Patron : ok
10:02:12 - Zachary Grisham : That is to let the search bar know that is an entire keyword
10:02:26 - Zachary Grisham : Also, note that I used OR and sectioned them off. 
10:02:41 - Zachary Grisham : This is so the search tool knows I am happy to include either of those in my search results.

10:03:51 - Patron : so I can select any of those sources in the link
10:04:09 - Zachary Grisham : Yep! Interesting though, notice at the bottom of these entries the subjects there is not a subject for liberal arts.
10:04:25 - Zachary Grisham : This means it is not a subject heading, which is likely why we are not getting exactly what we want.
10:04:37 - Patron : ok

It usually is pretty middle-of-the-road presenting various sides of arguments.

13:25:46 - Zachary Grisham : However, now that we have a call number I can just stroll into the stack to see if anything else is on the topic that may have a different spelling.
13:25:53 - Zachary Grisham : Mind waiting for a minute while I take a look?
13:26:14 - Patron : No of course not thank you for looking!
13:26:44 - Zachary Grisham : Awesome be right back!
13:40:38 - Zachary Grisham : Alright, apologies for the delay. So they seem to be mentioned on books that are about Plains Native Americans on those in the midwest. 
13:40:53 - Zachary Grisham : However, in the stacks I was unable to find a book entirely on them. 
13:41:38 - Zachary Grisham : As an example, enduring nations talks about their integration into the surrounding settler population.

13:44:17 - Patron : Ok thank you. So to get access to this book do I need to go to king library and get it?
13:44:36 - Zachary Grisham : Yep, but it looks like there are also publications directly from the Myaamia center.

13:46:12 - Patron : Ok sounds good. I think I will try and get that then because I need two different sources for this project.

13:47:05 - Patron : Or in my possesion
13:47:17 - Zachary Grisham : That is a good question, if they are library use only then they cannot be checked out. 
13:47:26 - Zachary Grisham : If it is in special collections you would need to ask them

20:52:36 - Patron : Okay thank you, I could send all of my notes from it if that would help
20:52:51 - Patron : Positive &amp; negative emotions enhance persuasion under certain circumstances - p 1
Social-functional approaches to emotion: emotions direct &amp; facilitate interactions between people &amp; that displays of emotions influence others - p 2
Friestad &amp; Wright’s persuasion-knowledge model (PKM)
People accumulate experience with persuasion throughout life
EXPERIMENT 1: In a study; people who wanted to persuade used more emotional language - p 2
Used the Evaluative Lexicon: quantifies language in terms of implied emotionality, valence &amp; extremity
Compared authentic Amazon reviews to those in the study that were suggested to persuade an audience or low intent to persuade an audience
Subtle shift in study participants’ language towards emotionality while persuading was found
EXPERIMENT 2: testing if the relation between emotionality &amp; persuasiveness is more deliberate or automatic - p 3
Participants listed adjectives describing a 5-star book; were told that future participants would read these when deciding which to select
Incentive added: participant would “receive” $1 for each future participant that selected their book
Participants with incentive to persuade utilized words with higher emotionality
EXPERIMENT 3: testing whether people use greater emotionality when they try to de-influence others than when trying to influence them
Participants asked to recall a book that they were unfavorable towards
Same incentive as before except participants “receive” $1 when future participants select the book they’ve described to avoid
High intent to persuade used greater emotionality
Emotionality correlated to participants’ attempts to convey certainty
EXPERIMENT 4: testing the strength of effect observed in the previous experiments
Used restaurants instead of books
Participants wrote review on last restaurant they went to
Same incentive as before; participants “receive” $1 for every future participant that chooses their restaurant
4 different “groupings”
Low-intent-to-persuade: baseline condition
Participants in the persuade conditions had a tendency to express higher extremity than those with low intent to persuade
Participants trying to appeal to “emotionalists” used higher emotionality
Participants still used higher emotionality even when told the group that their descriptions was tailored to would be more convinced by cognitive information
EXPERIMENT 5: testing if people related certain words to persuasiveness
Based on participants’ association and spee

Thing is, I can't actually remember or find the official name of that certification -- the course was accredited through the College Reading and Learning Association (CRLA) and was taken through Miami Regionals during the Fall 2019-2020 semester. Do you have a record of this course program or know where I could find the official name of the certification?
Thank you in advance for your time!","","5","","13:10:43 - Abigail Morgan : You can check a couple of places that might have this information. The General Bulletin from that year (https://miamioh.edu/academic-programs/bulletin.html). If you have access to Canvas still you can check there. Otherwise I would recommend reaching out to your instructor for the course if possible.

Since this is run through CTE you may want to contact them to see why you are not able to get access. I can also ask around the library to see what information I can find!

11:55:28 - Patron : okay thank you
11:57:33 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Another librarian mentioned that Farmer may have a study room system that works by QR Code like McVey and Health Sciences but we haven't been able to confirm that. Here is more information about their facilities: <a href=""https://miamioh.edu/fsb/about/facilities.html"" target=""_blank"">https://miamioh.edu/fsb/about/facilities.html</a>. They do include a number to call at the bottom of the page

12:00:37 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I'm curious myself and can try calling Farmer to see how this works
12:04:52 - Jaclyn Spraetz : Talking to someone now at Farmer and getting transferred. Hopefully I hear something from them! I will let you know
12:09:01 - Jaclyn Spraetz : I received a contact person (Irene Pierce: 513-529-1628) but it looks like she's out of the office. If you want to try to call that number or reach out to her at piercei@miamioh.edu, she may be able to help you!

Let me see what we have for this. Please hold on.
14:53:53 - Patron : Sure. I appreciate your help. Also would you please check the one called Ineqalities de Khintchine dans Cp ( l &lt; p &lt; infinity ) , C . R . Acad. Sc. Paris
303 (1986), 289--292.
14:56:57 - Barry Zaslow : For the first one I did see the title cited once in Google Scholar but we don't have the article. You can try Interlibrary Loan here: <a href=""https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html"" target=""_blank"">https://ill.lib.miamioh.edu/illiad/logon.html</a>. If you have not yet used this service create an account using your unique ID/password and put ""new request"" ""article"" then fill in the boxes with your citation. It looks to be from 1990 at Universite de Paris-Sud by the author Lust-Piquard.
14:57:03 - Barry Zaslow : I will check on the other one now.
14:57:49 - Patron : Alright thank you. Do I need to pay for this one using the loan website?
14:58:17 - Barry Zaslow : No, it is covered by the library's budget for any current students, faculty, or staff affiliated with Miami Univ.
15:04:02 - Barry Zaslow : The other one did not surface for me so I'd recommend doing the ILL procedure for that as well. I assume the title has ""Inequalities"" rather than ""Ineqalities"" but even fixing that spelling did not help, although there are many similar articles out there. Usually if Sheila can find these at another school they will scan the paper and send you an e-mail with a link to a PDF. Hope this helps.
15:04:33 - Barry Zaslow : Sheila is the main staff expert in Interlibrary Loan, just to clarify.
15:04:50 - Patron : Alright appreciate it!
15:05:30 - Barry Zaslow : Any others at this time? We have other staff taking over the chat service now so if not I will sign off.

12:55:53 - Zachary Grisham : Is there a particular type of nobel winner you would like to read.

12:56:17 - Zachary Grisham : You could easily pick up any of those.
12:56:34 - Zachary Grisham : I am betting that every one of those awards will have something like this.
12:57:17 - Patron : I'm not sure it's a lot of options to go through, I guess I'd like a fiction novel, preferably with a female protagonist, nothing over 300-400 words as I'm worried about finishing in time.

13:02:56 - Zachary Grisham : You could look up specific books and choose one that way though.

18:59:26 - Abigail Morgan : The other thing you can do, since this might be relevant is say when you accessed it, since information on those pages might not be static
18:59:35 - Abigail Morgan : APA actually gives a lot of flexibility
18:59:48 - Patron : Can you send an example of the in-text citation with the n.d. and an access date
18:59:56 - Patron : I want to see what both look like
18:59:59 - Abigail Morgan : sure
19:00:00 - Patron : Thank you for
19:03:49 - Abigail Morgan : Actually, sorry, I just remembered the correct way to do this is not at all what I said. You would give them names like (rgcoffee.com, n.d.a.; 

rgcoffee.com

, n.d.b.; 

rgcoffee.com

, n.d.c.)
19:04:17 - Patron : how would you do if hypothetically if there was a date?
19:04:40 - Patron : Also, where do you place the distinguishing letters on the citation in the reference page
19:04:49 - Abigail Morgan : where the date is
19:05:13 - Abigail Morgan : APA does it by date. If this was a normal citation it would be something like Smith 2020a and Smith 2020b
19:05:13 - Patron : Can you give me an example
19:05:21 - Patron : Perfect.
19:05:23 - Patron : Sorry
19:05:31 - Abigail Morgan : no worries, it is is confusing!
19:05:51 - Patron : Thank you for your help. How late is the online chat open 'til?
19:05:57 - Patron : Just curious for next time

Students will display their Personal Codices, constructed based on their study of Mesoamerican codices and their visit to Special Collections to consult the facsimiles of several of these from Aztec, Maya, and Mixtec cultures. Students used the Makerspace for a variety of manufacturing techniques in order to tell their own personal stories in the narrative style and form of these ancient manuscripts. Speak with student docents, who will guide you through interpretation of the process and results, and peruse the variety of interpretations of techniques and symbolism that students used to create their own life narratives.

Relating archaeology to modern pompeii

I was wondering if you had anything on this? the functionality of it? or the history behind it?","","17","","15:45:09 - Abigail Morgan : Hi, are you researching this for an assignment? If so, what are you are being asked to use this artifact for?
15:45:37 - Patron : Hi yea It is for an assignment and im being asked to research and find the use and historical background behind it
15:46:33 - Abigail Morgan : We probably don't have anything on this exact artifact itself, but I'm sure we have something on perfume or oil jars in Roman culture/Pompeii
15:47:33 - Patron : that would be nice, is it not possible to search up the ID number M47530 in the archive. I'm not sure how that works. if it's an oil or perfume jar, I didn't know that which is cool.
15:48:39 - Abigail Morgan : Which archive did you get this artifact description from?
15:48:59 - Patron : the Archaeology Lab in Upham
15:50:11 - Abigail Morgan : OK, that number is probably unique to that archive and it is not connected with the library. The last line you copied to me says it is probably an oil or perfume jar, that's where I got that information, so that's why I suggested it
15:51:12 - Patron : ok cool yea I would like some material on that subject then. do you have any recommendations on how to use the archaeology lab archive? or connections?
15:51:52 - Abigail Morgan : No, sorry, I don't know those resources. Here is a search I did on Google Scholar about perfume and Pompeii - <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C36&amp;q=pompeii+perfume&amp;btnG="" target=""_blank"">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C36&amp;q=pompeii+perfume&amp;btnG=</a>

Another source says Alumni was the main library until King was completed in 1966. Can you find out which date is correct? I've never heard the 1973 date before. I also want to make sure that the Wertz Art and Architecture Library is still in Alumni Hall since music and BEST are no longer with us. Thanks.","","14","","10:51:24 - Patron : Hi, Barry.
10:51:45 - Barry Zaslow : Hi Donna. Nice to hear from you. When you say ""this site"" do you mean the library main page(s)?
10:52:22 - Patron : Yes, I'm sorry. I thought you could tell where I was.
10:52:51 - Patron : I'm back.
10:55:24 - Barry Zaslow : No, we just get the question(s) in a separate window/program called LibAnswers and all we see are the person's name (or ""guest"") and the few words of the query. Anyway, Art/Arch is still at Alumni Hall in Room 007 and their hours should be under hours on the library home page. I will forward your question to Jacky in Archives since I don't have any sources to confirm which is really true. I think there was a period where one of them was more for graduate students but don't quote me on that (perhaps that was the 1966-1973 interim).
10:56:17 - Patron : Thanks!
10:57:00 - Barry Zaslow : Here's the Art/Arch direct web link: <a href=""https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/about/locations/art-arch/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.lib.miamioh.edu/about/locations/art-arch/</a>

10:58:58 - Patron : Jacky will probably call me. She usually prefers the phone to email, although she also has my email. I'll look up the site. I don't always trust that what I'm seeing on a site is current, which is why I asked. Thanks for your help.
10:59:20 - Barry Zaslow : OK. However you/she prefer to communicate.
10:59:40 - Patron : Turns out I was on that site. That's where the 1973 date is listed.
10:59:53 - Barry Zaslow : You are correct about currency. They are still listing staff who left in 2016 as responsible for some areas! (sigh)
11:01:04 - Patron : You can forward emails and chats you don't want to handle to those staff members.
11:02:47 - Barry Zaslow : Ha! Sadly, all those who left in 2016 were truly good colleagues, though and very helpful to patrons.

12:49:49 - Abigail Morgan : Yes
12:50:11 - Abigail Morgan : Your citations are in alphabetical order and your annotations are directly under each citation
12:51:11 - Patron : Okay, for a 7-10 page paper how ,many references do you think I need?
12:51:50 - Abigail Morgan : Is the annotated bibliography 7-10 pages long?
12:52:33 - Patron : Here are the instructions, This part of your project needs to include specific evidence (quotes, paraphrases) from at least five sources. Use the library Research Guide Links to an external site. to find books, journal articles, and newspaper articles, Internet research (though be sure to evaluate all websites Links to an external site. carefully for credibility), and field research (interviews with people who can provide you with important and credible information on this topic).
12:54:48 - Abigail Morgan : OK, thanks. Generally your annotations can be as long or as short as needed. You might use 1 page for just 1 source. Or you can put 2-3 on a page
12:55:12 - Abigail Morgan : So if you have to have at least 7 pages in your annotated bibliography, I would say try to get at least 7-8 sources
12:56:04 - Patron : Are you able to help me find good sources?
12:56:15 - Abigail Morgan : Sure what are you looking for
12:56:19 - Patron : Women's Achievements in Latin America, Asia, or Africa
12:56:46 - Abigail Morgan : OK, we will probably need to limit that to just one geographic area
12:57:31 - Abigail Morgan : and is there a particular kind of achievement you are interested in? political, entertainment, science, literature, etc.?
12:58:27 - Patron : No, that's the topic of what my paper is on Im open to exploring anything
12:59:34 - Abigail Morgan : Got it. I'm just saying that it would probably be easiest to narrow down that topic so you can find sources without getting hundreds or thousands of results
12:59:54 - Patron : Okay, that works!
13:01:32 - Abigail Morgan : OK, so here is what I found just searching for women's achievement and Latin America - <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;bquery=women%26%2339%3bs+achievement+AND+(+latin+america+or+south+america+or+central+america+)&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;bquery=women%26%2339%3bs+achievement+AND+(+latin+america+or+south+america+or+central+america+)&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site</a>
13:01:55 - Abigail Morgan : But if we can use other keywords like women in STEM or women authors or something we might get more specific results
13:02:25 - Abigail Morgan : <a href=""https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;bquery=women+in+STEM+AND+(+latin+america+or+south+america+or+central+america+)&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site"" target=""_blank"">https://proxy.lib.miamioh.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;bquery=women+in+STEM+AND+(+latin+america+or+south+america+or+central+america+)&amp;type=1&amp;searchMode=Standard&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site</a>
13:02:34 - Abigail Morgan : Like this for example
13:03:24 - Abigail Morgan : So if there is something you wanted to focus on specifically like 'women athletes in Africa' that would be a different search strategy than women in STEM in Latin America
13:03:56 - Abigail Morgan : You can always use Articles and More to find sources - <a href=""https://eds.p.ebscohost.com/eds/search/advanced?vid=0&amp;sid=309f4ff4-2ac3-41b9-8f4b-10c0a3548206%40redis"" target=""_blank"">https://eds.p.ebscohost.com/eds/search/advanced?vid=0&amp;sid=309f4ff4-2ac3-41b9-8f4b-10c0a3548206%40redis</a>

13:26:46 - Mark Dahlquist : On that screenshare, I've indicated where Statista provides an option to provide a citation formatting in your citation style of choice.<br />
13:26:58 - Mark Dahlquist : So I would suggest using that tool to cite this.<br />
13:27:16 - Patron : Thank you! I just accessed it.

14:10:41 - Zachary Grisham : That seems to be the section your professor is talking about.
14:11:47 - Zachary Grisham : Not sure I was clear, that is the tab your professor was likely referring to when they said ""includes a tab about finding medialinks""
14:12:27 - Zachary Grisham : In respect to your topic. 
14:12:38 - Zachary Grisham : Is there any specific type of achievement?
14:14:17 - Patron : No, I wrote about quite a few in paper. She said I can talk about as many as I wish to. Does the media finding have to be what she recommended or can we browse other sites?
14:14:55 - Zachary Grisham : I personally think you should browse all the library resources, however, you would have to ask your professor. I do not want to mislead you.
14:15:16 - Zachary Grisham : Give me a moment to search the relevant section for possible useful resources 
14:22:28 - Zachary Grisham : Alright, it looks like that is specifically asking not only about finding relevant information to back up your assertions. But specifically charts, videos and pictures to back them up.
14:22:47 - Zachary Grisham : I believe that is why the professor said to use that tab, not that it is the only resource you can use. 
14:23:33 - Patron : Ok
14:25:07 - Zachary Grisham : So, did you want help just finding resources to back up your assertions. Such as encyclopedia entries, articles etc....
14:25:22 - Zachary Grisham : Or were you asking for help finding media, such as pictures, or other infographics.
14:27:05 - Patron : Am I just supposed to provide an infographic and have a resource for that or am I writing a page on it?
14:28:05 - Zachary Grisham : Oh, it looked to me like you just needed to include one. 
14:28:19 - Zachary Grisham : Not write a paper on how you would include one.
14:28:25 - Patron : Sorry it's not to much details in the instructions or a rubric.
14:28:52 - Zachary Grisham : It is ok, based on what you sent me it looks like you just need to include media in your project.
14:29:04 - Zachary Grisham : So, including a chart, map, infographic, etc...
14:29:15 - Zachary Grisham : Not write a paper on how you would include it.
14:29:22 - Patron : Can I just pick one or do you think I should do all
14:29:41 - Zachary Grisham : Oh, they looked to just be examples of what you could include.
14:29:46 - Zachary Grisham : Not an exhaustive list
14:29:54 - Zachary Grisham : Due to that, I would say you do not have to do all. 
14:30:18 - Zachary Grisham : But it seems like your professor does want multiple types of media.
14:30:24 - Zachary Grisham : I would ask them to make sure!
14:31:01 - Patron : Okay, and just use the link she provided to find those medias?
14:31:39 - Zachary Grisham : Yep, those are different databases to find that type of media. I would also suggest using Statista though, they are prime for this type of stuff
14:31:46 - Zachary Grisham : One moment and I will get you the link.

14:32:47 - Zachary Grisham : This database is pretty cool because you do simple keyword searches and it provides graphs and maps of data relevant to your search
14:33:23 - Patron : Got it, thank you1
14:33:33 - Zachary Grisham : You are welcome! Did that answer your questions?
14:33:49 - Zachary Grisham : If so, can I help you with anything else?
14:34:35 - Patron : Yes, I'll provide 2-3 and have sources for those. If that seems correct.
14:35:36 - Zachary Grisham : It sounds like it would fulfill what is being asked of you. Make sure to confirm with your professor though. Statista should make it easy to find visualizations for any topic you are interested in and it provides source information for your citation
14:35:49 - Patron : Got it!
14:36:14 - Zachary Grisham : Alright, if you have any problems feel free to reach out again. If not, hope you have a wonderful finals week!

09:16:53 - Kristen Adams : Let me check for you
09:18:48 - Kristen Adams : I checked our e-journals tab on the homepage, that's where you'd search for individual titles like this, but I'm not seeing it
09:21:33 - Patron : Hmm, OK. It seems odd that Miami would not want a subscription, since it's a major title in a major discipline and would, it seems, be in broad demand across campus (but maybe not?) Thanks for checking. I know the Lane Library system does not subscribe; I would have guessed that a university library would be more likely to have it.
09:24:01 - Kristen Adams : It's possible we've had it in the past, I'm not sure. I can mention it to the collections group, but our collections budget is undergoing reductions and we're needing to review and cancel titles right now, so we aren't exploring new subscriptions. 
09:24:41 - Patron : Thanks for checking. I appreciate it.
09:24:53 - Kristen Adams : Your welcome. Enjoy the coming break.
